# London, Day 2

Yesterday, I saw quite a bit of London. Despite the fact that London is the capital of England, I would more likely describe it as capital of the world, given its vast cultural breadth. English being the official language and yet I hear more of other languages in passing than it. That in itself is beautiful, but in some ways disorientating when I realize I understand so much that I overhear that I am doing mental interpretive code-switching. I suppose someone who doesn't understand it, it's just a lot of noise to tune out, but when I'm walking and I hear someone say, "Looking at her teeth makes me feel sick" in one language and then "Dad, why aren't apples blue?" in another while I'm trying to talk myself... I sometimes am all over the place mentally.  There's no one "other" group. Chinese, Ghanaian, French, Spanish, Malaysian, Brazilian, Turkish. So I first saw a bunch of touristy things, like Westminster Abbey, Big Ben, and Buckingham Palace. The place I'm staying is by Hyde Park, so my first experience was taking the Tube (London's metro). I've been on many public transit systems in my travels and have seen a lot of variety in how underground trains are implemented. London's I would say is like a hybrid of the Paris Metro and the NYC subway. Old, good coverage, but not impossible to figure out. There is a circular route that runs round the city and drops off at some of the more major stations like Paddington, Victoria, and Westminster. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d6a5lws](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d6a5lws.jpg) Most of the touristy stuff didn't impress me. I know everyone says you're supposed to want to see all this stuff that is historically significant, but for me, traveling isn't about validation of stuff I already know. It's about discovering stuff I'm completely unaware of. I suppose I would have more respect if some of these things had not become bizarre caricatures of themselves. For example, we passed by a neighborhood that was completely locked off and guarded by men at the gates with large assault rifles. The prime minister lives there. Not right there, not anywhere visible from the gates, yet people stand there taking photos as if there is something to see. If I had been personally invited inside the home of the prime minister, it'd be a different matter, I suppose. There was the changing of the guards at the palace while there. I thought it was cool to see the guards up close because if you really look at their faces, there is a lot of vulnerability to be found. Rosy-cheeked youth, all dolled up in a costume, holding a weapon that is really all for show. To me, it's like someone dressing up as a character at a Disney theme park. I know that's a terrible comparison to make because these guys have received formal training and are very disciplined, but the touristy aspect of these places takes away from that. It's more ornate than functional. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d6a5m0n](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d6a5m0n.jpg)I saw St. James' Park along with this long footpath which takes you along the south bank on the River Thames. On this footpath, there are all these street performers, mostly the living statues, which you'll see in a lot of bigger European cities. At some point, Dom told me I should go punch a statue in the back of its head. For a moment, I was thinking it was a real statue and almost ran over to do just that because... why not? One thing that has confused me about England is the way restaurants work. In America, you will enter a restaurant, be greeted by a hostess, and then be taken to where you sit. A few moments later, a waiter/waitress will come to take your order. This doesn't apply to fast food places that have a very clearly marked counter, usually with some sort of "ORDER HERE" sign. Basically, everything is pretty clearly spelled out for you. In Europe, aside from fast food places, the standard is to enter the restaurant and seat yourself. Sometimes this involves gesturing to a waiter "hey I'm here," and maybe some conversation in between to indicate that you need a menu (because you won't get it automatically in certain restaurants in some countries, like Croatia). In England, however, it seems like it's customary to order before seating regardless of the setting. I was really thrown off by it. I'm sure if I had been on my own, no one would have thought anything of it and eventually a waiter would have shown up and everything would have gone as is and I'd leave England thinking that it's just like the rest of Europe. So it's not like people are strict about it or anything or that there is any impoliteness, it's just customs and the "norm." I don't really have a preference for how it should work, though I tend to find places where you seat yourself and are at the mercy of a waiter's time are often painfully slow. But service in England seems quick. I had fish and chips with "mushy peas." Peas were the one vegetable my parents allowed me to not like when I was a kid. They said I could have one and that was all I was allowed. I tend to stand happily by that choice because I like every other vegetable (if prepared properly!) but peas are often bland and starchy, so I never feel like I am missing out on anything. But as an adult, well, I'll eat anything. I'm not at all picky with food. As I noted to Dom, who likely thinks I'm crazy for it, I would even try human meat if there were some way to do it humanely and safely. I try to be healthy but I see no point in holding back from culinary adventure. The peas were, well, a "mush," a paste, like refried beans but green. They had a faint flavor to them, which I first thought was basil, but I believe it was actually mint. I know that's a weird thing to get mixed up, but when it is inside something as starchy as peas, the flavoring is overwhelmed by that. The fish was very flakey. I think that's an indication that it is well prepared, because then the fish is fresh. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d6a9btj](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d6a9btj.jpg) "OK, who'd like a banger in the mouth? Oh that's right, in the States, you call it a sausage in the mouth." "We just call it sausage." The whole day, there were people walking around in T-shirts for some sort of marathon or race that was the Cancer and Colitis Run. It just kept looking like "Coitus Run" though. This made me remember that when I was maybe 7 or 8 years old, my parents had a medical dictionary that used the word "coitus" a lot and that, not being familiar with that word, because I'm not 85 years old, I somehow decided that it was synonymous with "ringworm." I can't think of the moment in which I really found out what coitus was but I'm sure it was groundbreaking for me. There was a cool skate park and also the Tate Modern, which had many floors of awesome art on exhibit, and some not so awesome. Marko Rothko's work was on exhibit. The theme of the displays were surrealist "poetry and dream." Rothko's pieces are just like giant two-tone works with a single block of paint overlaying another. It's in that awkward zone of controversy where no one can really be sure if it's art or not. Sometimes I think anything is art if it inspires a discussion of what is art. Mostly, though, I don't think it's up to the artist to determine what is art. It's up to the audience.
