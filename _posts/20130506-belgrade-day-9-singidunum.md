# Belgrade, Day 9: Singidunum!

Yesterday was Easter in Serbia. Unlike Easter in Zagreb and unlike May Day here, it wasn't really a ghost town. A lot of stuff was open and there were a lot of people out with their families in the parks.  I noticed yesterday as I posted something to Facebook, that it geolocated me as being in Singidunum. That's the name Belgrade had when it was occupied by the Romans. It's also the name of a university in Belgrade but that's actually south of Belgrade, nowhere near where I am. Weird! I learned a bit about Great War Island. I was told that at some point there was a lot of ado about making it into an amusement park. Right now it's this fairly large island at the confluence of the Sava and Danube. Speaking of language yesterday, it's great that we have a word to describe the intersection of rivers, for the three times I've ever had to use that word in my life :D ![great_war_island_by_fartprincess-d64a84c](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/great_war_island_by_fartprincess-d64a84c.jpg) Great War Island is mostly just an uninhabited nature reserve. And I'm not really sure how to get to it since there's no ferry that runs to it, although the notion of there being a ferry for an island so close to land seems ridiculous. It reminds me of Super Mario Sunshine where you find a dude that's been shipwrecked on an island for "many years" and then you pan right and can see the mainland in swimmable distance, haha. I'm mostly just interested in the island because it's home to like, 200 different species of birds. I ♥ birds. Except grackles. I don't ♥ them. 

# Mysterious Note Solved

The note I had posted in my journal yesterday I was able to translate for the most part. I rescind my remarks that the authors were 19. They are more like 16 or if not, at least emotionally 16. Like two high school students. We don't ever learn the names of the girls, but I'm going to call them Sofija and Biljana. We do get the names of two boys, however, Momir and Goran. Sofija has dated Momir and she's clearly a total bitch of a girlfriend who doesn't give a shit about him and says that he bores her and she's ready to go be with this other guy instead. Biljana is all like, "Gurl u cray cray, you gonna end up wit' nothin' if you don't stop messin' 'round." (I don't ever get to talk like this, just let me have it). The two go back and forth about weird bullshit "The Rules" type bonkers manipulation about who messages who first and how many days it's been and blah blah blah. And then we find out that Goran actually has a girlfriend and that Sofija doesn't want to be his "sumpin' sumpin' on the side." And then Biljana concludes, "Eh this isn't really that big of a deal based on everything." And then I drive an icepick into my skull because it's so boring and awful and mundane and who has time to give a shit about any of this. Thanks everyone who provided moral support and nudged me in the right direction without giving away the secret :) I also learned that while Blaywatch is a pun on Baywatch, it's also a pun on a slang word in Belgrade "blejanje" which literally translates in Serbian to "bleat" but in this context it's like "to laze around." Kind of funny. Like a goat hanging around doing nothing. I've also learned a little bit about the gypsies (the girls in the above letter, despite what a friend of mine suggested, I do not believe actually are gypsies but just really stupid illiterate teen girls). I'll also fairly call them Romani/Roma for a moment, because that's what they are properly called. The ones here in Serbia are called Machvaya and they live in a little shantytown near Brankov Most. 

# Tašmajadan

I went to Tašmajadan yesterday, but not before wandering up the steps of St. Mark's next to it. I merely peered inside as people ambled out doing the sign of the cross. One thing I have noticed in Serbia is that people do this a lot, even when just passing a statue on the street of questionable religious significance (questionable in the sense that I don't know its relevance, not that I am skeptical that it has some meaning to them). However, at St. Mark's, I almost laughed aloud because as a man and a woman came out, the woman kissed the door of the building all over, which isn't strange at all apparently--that's just common tradition in orthodox churches to kiss the door or the things inside. I had never seen someone kissing a door before though, so it caught me off-guard. I didn't bother going inside. One, because I have no desire to, but two, because I'm pretty sure they'd have to call an exorcist if I crossed the threshold. Their various regalia has done a superb job of warding off evil spirits such as myself. The park itself was pleasant. Lots of little playgrounds. The playgrounds here kind of disappoint me in comparison to Zagreb's. Bundek and Jarun had ridiculous climbing statues that put America's geodesic domes to shame. Here, the kids get these little pussy swingsets and see-saws and that's pretty much it. No kick-ass slides. No rock-climbing wall. It's really sad. And yet there are playgrounds everywhere. Every block has one--my apartment overlooks one... and it's definitely well-used. I have heard kids playing in the park at both 7:30AM and 2:30AM. And I am totally not making this up, as incredible as that sounds. However, this park had... and maybe this was only for the Easter holiday... a series of inflatable jumpy tent castles. I used to love those things. I sometimes wish they had them for adults. I will note that Belgrade has a piece of playground equipment I have not see since I was in Lima. The ones here are adorably sponsored by Kinder Surprise (which I learned in Italian, in the same vain as in Spanish, is Kinder Sorpresa, which is also adorable). It's an "egg" (although in Lima it was just a cage) that you get inside and you can spin it in circles using a wheel in the center. It's like a merry-go-round only you can spin it while on it rather than having people have to spin you. The ones here, unlike the ones in Lima, are sized only so a child (or someone small like me!) can fit inside. ![fa2e4b88b57311e2930822000a1fab4e_7__1__by_fartprincess-d64aazd](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/fa2e4b88b57311e2930822000a1fab4e_7__1__by_fartprincess-d64aazd.jpg) That's Saint Mark's in the background. And absolutely nothing interesting in the foreground other than the fact that all of these people are wearing jeans in what I consider to be weather that is way too hot to be wearing pants (28-29C, come on!) ![2ad54eb2b57411e2813a22000a1fb833_7_by_fartprincess-d64ab2y](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/2ad54eb2b57411e2813a22000a1fb833_7_by_fartprincess-d64ab2y.jpg) I was surprised to see this, too. Virginia license plates in Serbia? On a really old piece-of-shit car. I don't know how or why. I didn't check to see if they had proper Serb plates on the front. But I can't figure out why anyone would bother spending the money to ship their beat-up car here. I'm assuming this plate is only there for kitsch value. ![171f584cb57711e291b222000a1f98fa_7_by_fartprincess-d64ab2t](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/171f584cb57711e291b222000a1f98fa_7_by_fartprincess-d64ab2t.jpg) Another funny danger sign. Jaded skeleton. It looks like a postmodernist book cover from the 1960s. Milan Kundera's The Unbearable Lightness of Being Electrocuted.
