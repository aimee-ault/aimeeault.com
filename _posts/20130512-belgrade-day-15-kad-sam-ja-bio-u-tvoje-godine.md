# Belgrade, Day 15: Kad sam ja bio u tvoje godine...

I went with some friends yesterday to Zemun. I thought Zemun was its own town, but it's technically incorporated into Novi Beograd, even though it's a good 15km out of Beograd. From what I can understand, Zemun has a heavy war history of being sort of thrown back and forth between warring nations. Despite that, it remains very well preserved. It's a charming place.  It connects to Belgrade via the Danube quay. On the way there, I found Blaywatch! (The club the girls in the letter I found were writing about). It was indeed a splav (a nightclub on a boat). Gazing in, it looked like the lower level of the boat was underwater. Hopefully I was just imagining that. What got to me on the quay was that there were all these ice cream vendors. Tons of them. But no one was selling water. Or any beverage. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d64z5q9](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d64z5q9.jpg) The people on the quay were varied. There were a lot of doggish women wearing gaudy jewelry, dresses, and oversized straw hats. And a lot of inline skaters (I still can't get over how popular inline skating is here. It hasn't been a thing in the US since the 90s). Kids. It had this unique smell too... the wetland growth near the riverbank was like a culmination of fresh-cut grass, mold, flowers, and something else that had a very lively smell. The water looked stagnant in this part of the country. Maybe it's not typically, but on this day it was. ![2f76e170ba3c11e2a73b22000aa80571_7_by_fartprincess-d64z53m](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/2f76e170ba3c11e2a73b22000aa80571_7_by_fartprincess-d64z53m.jpg) **OK :( :( :(** On the side of the quay not facing the water were all these mini-amusement parks for children, including fair rides like roller coasters, jumpy tents, carousels, and slides. The coolest thing, however, was a giant 30 foot tall rock-climbing pillar. The harnesses sat at the bottom waiting for anyone who wanted to use to strap in and just climb freely. A kid was at the bottom struggling. Another guy was at the top yelling encouraging words down at him. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d64z5rz](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d64z5rz.jpg) On my way back later, after I parted with my friends, I decided to give it a go. I made it about halfway up the wall (so about 15 feet up) when my right fingers lost their grip. I sat there for a good 10 minutes, taking deep breaths, trying to re-establish my position. It was very difficult but I was determined to not give up. The spot for me to grab was so tiny though and I was relying entirely on core strength to keep pushing myself. Eventually the heat and the pressure caused some sweat to build up on my left hand and... I fell back in the harness. This was the scariest moment ever. I had no idea how well these harnesses worked. What was probably a 1/4 second fall felt like a year. But everyone was laughing. "Aw we scared the American." I just smiled and shook it off. ![acbabb38ba3811e291e622000a1f9d57_7_by_fartprincess-d64z52r](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/acbabb38ba3811e291e622000a1f9d57_7_by_fartprincess-d64z52r.jpg) ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d64z5sj](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d64z5sj.jpg) At the end of the quay, a bit further up through some steps (Zemun is very hilly) was Gardoš tower. It has a bunch of alternative names. I was calling it Millennium Tower. It also goes by Tower of Janos. I like that name best because it feels like I'm going to go meet J'zargo at the College of Winterhold to test some fire scrolls. The view from the tower was incredible. Not only could you see all of Zemun, but you could see the entirety of Great War Island and Beograd behind it. ![zemun_by_fartprincess-d64w6rn](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/zemun_by_fartprincess-d64w6rn.jpg) ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d64z5sv](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d64z5sv.jpg) Also, this happened: [embed]http://104.131.81/wp-content/uploads/untitled_by_fartprincess-d64w9ig.mp4[/embed] I don't know. My friends decided I needed to see the inside of some bazaar type shop. I don't know why. I think the vendor culture here is interesting. On the weekends, people in my neighborhood (Skadarlija, the Bohemian quarter) will come out and sell shit on their car hoods. The items they are selling make me feel sad, like this is all they have to sell. It's always like 10 items total, including some used ancient sneakers or a single set of dulled knives. One guy was selling a machete. I was tempted to buy it just to do a photo-shoot of myself holding a machete. And then leave it on the wall of give/take :D :D :D But sometimes someone manages to turn this into a store and so these stores are just huge accumulations of junk. It's like going to a flea market, I guess. A lot of it has been used. And is dirty. And is being sold for very cheap. Stuff no one should ever want. Like a phone that looks like the torso of a stripper: ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d64z5tq](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d64z5tq.jpg) Dragana told the store owner that I was American, and as a result, the woman was following me around, asking me if I liked everything I saw. Including this phone. I can't tell from that writing if that phone is going for 22.00 or 2200 Dinar. I can't imagine paying $22 for something like that. Funny thing, I think if you cleaned that phone up and packaged it, you could probably sell it in Urban Outfitters in the US for like $50 and some idiot hipster would buy it. When I went home, some guy ran after me, he said a lot of stuff in Serbian very fast but I heard the words "Mortal Kombat" in there. I looked at him and laughed. And then laughed some more. "I... don't speak Serbian very well, I'm sorry." He looked very embarrassed suddenly. "Oh you are... a foreigner. Oh. I'm sorry. I thought... [some word that sounded like 'raksi']" and then ran off. I was really confused :confused: I stopped into UŠĆE on my way home. ![bkaqhcsciae5o1h_by_fartprincess-d64z6wf](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/bkaqhcsciae5o1h_by_fartprincess-d64z6wf.jpg) I was expecting a more volatile reaction from the Croats for me wearing their checkered armband in conjunction with the Serb shit :) I'm a bad troll.
