# Zagreb, Day 27: Wiener Surprise by the Sea

Today, Luka took me to Selce, which is a little village on the northwestern part of Croatia (well, not too far north, it's still far from Rijeka), right on the Adriatic Sea. He lives there during the summer, but it's, despite the very warm weather right now, still off-season there, so it was quiet.  The drive out there was conflicting in some ways because I [personally] think Luka drives like a maniac. Okay, not really but being someone who does not own a car and is in one very infrequently, my perceptions of driving are funny. I also have very bad depth perception so I often think things are much closer than they are. But on the other hand, the drive out was awesome because it was very scenic! From Zagreb, it starts off as this sort of mundane flat landscape that quickly goes into the mountains. The mountains are hard for me to describe because they don't remind me of any I've ever passed through, yet they have a familiar vibe. They are rocky and gray yet covered with a forest green brush... and they are expansive, towering walls that open up in these vast overlooks... where you can't really focus your eyes on any one thing in particular--it makes you feel tiny, so tiny. This doesn't really do any justice but it's one of the first car pics I took when I first started to notice something awesome awaited: ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d625xcz](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d625xcz.jpg) The green bit in the middle is where a bug jizzed on the windshield or something, not a meteor spectacularly careening into the Earth as it might look. Sorry, I wasn't in Russia for that :D There are a few tunnels and then the final tunnel opens up and the Adriatic Sea is suddenly there on the left. But apparently being tiny is not advantageous when you want to see over a giant barrier blocking the left side of the road. I couldn't really see it! But it was okay because a few moments later, there it was. There was a bit of construction going on prior to getting there. They were busy building an additional section of the highway at that point, because I guess some of these smaller towns complain about the volume of traffic that cut straight through them (standard American type first-world complaints--"Wah, we like our small community and don't want outsiders roaring through in their fast cars. Wah, you built a highway and now all of our tiny restaurants have lost customers from tourists"). 

# Abrupt Discussion of Croatia's Education System and Mandatory Military Draft

But it was cool seeing the construction actively take place. It seemed to be going much faster than American road construction often does. Obviously in response to heavy demand. Seeing all the construction made me wonder if people here go to school to be traffic engineers. Really, it made me question the college education system here entirely and how collegiate majors and degrees are decided upon. Luka has talked to me quite a bit about the education system here... although I think college is extremely overrated, seeing how educational systems are built fascinates me. For example, and this is probably easy to assume, they don't have the same types of standardized testing for high school students. There's no equivalent of the SAT in Croatia. They have some sort of 3-pronged exit exam, but to me, that seems comparable with the 11th grade exit exam most American schools have. But yeah, people do go to school to be traffic engineers in Croatia (surprise!). A few years ago (Google tells me this is no longer true as of 2008), all Croatian men not enrolled in school were subject to compulsory military service. If you objected to arms-training due to your own pacifist lifestyle, you would get thrown into civil service instead. The interesting caveat here is that while for the former, you'd be provided housing and everything else... the civil service did not provide housing accommodations or any sort of allowance/pay for you to survive during this term. I'm not really surprised by that, to be honest. Anyway, back to this village. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d625con](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d625con.jpg) For being a tiny little village, it interestingly has different beaches. The main part is like a cement boardwalk which is mostly for the benefit of the boats in the marina. A bit further down, it turns into heavier rocks, and then further on more of a fine wash of pebbles. There may have been some sort of "sand" beach but I didn't see it (and the beach did go further on into a campground). ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d625cn5](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d625cn5.jpg) ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d625cod](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d625cod.jpg) I had the honor of eating another fantastic "wiener surprise." This one was less of a surprise because the hot dog was poking out of the bun. I feel really gross having just typed that. I also noticed the name this time. It's pecivo hrenovka. In case you needed to know the formal name for "HOT DOG IN BREAD." In case you were ever in Croatia and could not resist the temptation of "wiener surprise" as I will forever call it. I will adamantly profess that pecivo hrenovka is pretty good, despite my joking attitude towards it. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d625ci5](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d625ci5.jpg) The stony parts of town reminded me, and I feel ashamed to share this, of maps like Azshara from World of Warcraft. I half-expected to see a Naga patrol by as I walked down the main promenade. I feel the need to share that I have not played World of Warcraft in a very, very long time. I am that retard that quotes fake bible quotes on Team Fortress 2 servers though. There's no escaping that reality. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d625cnh](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d625cnh.jpg) ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d625cnz](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d625cnz.jpg) ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d625cmu](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d625cmu.jpg)
