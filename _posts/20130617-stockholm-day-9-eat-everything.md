# Stockholm, Day 9: Eat Everything

Today I am happy because I am leaving Stockholm and going to Amsterdam for a few days. I don't want to get all down on Stockholm. It was just a very difficult city to have an opinion of because there is so much diversity and trying to find a starting point to dig in was difficult. At the same time, I feel too much comfort in places like this and being in west Europe is making me consider my need to return to South America so that I can be somewhere where I feel challenged but still survive. So I'm starting to think about that.  Anyway, what I take away best from Sweden was food. Swedish meatballs with lingonberry sauce. Potato pancakes with chives and roe. Grilled char and plenty of fish served with potatoes. And although it's not distinctively Swedish, an ample amount of things like yakisoba and fisk korma. Sweden's supermarkets have a lot of stuff like this: ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d69eocq](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d69eocq.jpg)There were whole aisles dedicated to varieties of mayonaise, all claiming to be "American." They also are sure to remind you that it is tasty, in case you purchased it with the expectation that it was going to taste like Purina dog chow that had sat baking in the sun for 3 weeks on a slab of lead-coated sheet metal. Make sure you try it on a club sandwich, the tube reminds you, lest you squeeze the entire bottle atop a hearty bowl of pistachio ice cream in a hazy stupor. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d69eoeq](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d69eoeq.jpg) I tried sushi here because I figured it was probably good, given its proximity to the ocean. This octopus was so fresh that I could faintly taste seawater on it. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d69eof3](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d69eof3.jpg) Asparagus soup. I didn't order this but they accidentally gave it to me and I decided I didn't care and just ran with it. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d69eoks](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d69eoks.jpg) Lingonberry, meatballs, potatoes, and apple. Not from IKEA. A friend of mine from Los Angeles asked me to go to IKEA. I was told not to go to IKEA. That it would just be huge and with even more Swedish than the American (well yeah, of course it would, why wouldn't it). ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d69eoiy](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d69eoiy.jpg) Korma. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d69eoil](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d69eoil.jpg) I don't remember the name of this, but I think there is a Little Debbie snack cake modeled after it. This tea room was serious business and forbid you from using your laptop inside even though they had free WiFi. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d69eohr](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d69eohr.jpg) This was in every grocery store and convenience store. I ate some candy one night. I don't know how Swedes eat 18kg a year. I felt like I was about to enter a diabetic coma. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d69eoh7](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d69eoh7.jpg) Dude, you don't even know the half of it. When I'm sitting around with my Mountain Dew and my Doritos and my fedora and am fucking around with my xorg.conf file in my distribution of Ubuntu Christian Edition (why the hell does this exist), all bets are off on who the real Cool American is (it's me). I'm not sure if I'm really entitled to joke about being this kind of nerd given that I ran Gentoo for 3 years and have considered going back :) ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d69eq8i](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d69eq8i.jpg) I have no idea if I ate this properly. It looked like American hashbrowns. Each topping came in a little serving dish with 4 spoons. So I just dumped it all on top, super classy. Proof that I didn't get fat eating all of this: ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d69eome](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d69eome.jpg) I did get more fake blind though. Here's a guy I caught taking selfies of himself in a restaurant: ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d69eqcb](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d69eqcb.jpg) I kind of hope he has one of those weird apps on his phone that puts weird sparkly graphics on top of photos, haha. Seeing this just incites me to want to take really awkward selfies in weird places, like on planes or in grocery lines or while actually shoveling food into my mouth. Or in the background of someone else's selfie. Selfie photobombs.
