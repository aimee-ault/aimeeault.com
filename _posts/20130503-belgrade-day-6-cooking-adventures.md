# Belgrade, Day 6: Cooking Adventures

It's been bothersomely hot in Belgrade the past day or two. Restless sweaty sleep with no blanket, the balcony door wide open. I have AC but I forget to turn it on and around 5AM, as I turn to my side, the thick vitriolic smell of smoke saunters into my room. Every morning. Stirs me from my sleep, I step up and out to the balcony, the sun is faintly rising and this is in the middle of a 2 hour window of time each day where it is actually quiet for once. Directly below me they are smoking meat and it's still early so the smell is like a brush fire rather than the intoxicating aroma of sausage.  ![685f93b2b3d211e2926822000a1f9c9b_7_by_fartprincess-d63x765](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/685f93b2b3d211e2926822000a1f9c9b_7_by_fartprincess-d63x765.jpg) Yesterday, as I was walking back to my apartment from Studentski Trg, I somehow did a 180 and ended up going back to where I came from. It was so hot and sunny outside that I didn't think I would be able to make it back without stopping to drink something. All of the stores here sell countless numbers of juices. Often in flavors I don't think are particularly common in the US, like jagoda (strawberry) or ribizla (currant). As I was leaving, a woman started to talk to me in serbian. She had a very slow way of speaking so I decided to just run with it. I was understanding parts of it, sometimes full sentences. But I kept getting confused. She kept using the word "kaj." In Serbo-Croatian this means the interrogative "what." However, in Esperanto, this means "and." My brain lets my first understanding of that word take precedence and so I kept thinking, "and...??" There's a few other words like this where they are bizarrely similar if not exact, but kaj is a weird one because in Esperanto, its etymology is from the same word which comes from Ancient Greek. The word is also present in Lojban (haha). It has etymologies in several language families but Serbo-Croatian is the only one where it's not conjunctive or prepositional. In trying to find the etymology, I found out that this is also an Armenian word for "spirits of storm and wind." I can only rightly assume the woman was code-switching between Armenian and Serbian and was actually recounting a fantastic mythological cautionary tale about mystic werewolves or something. I told one of my friends I've met here about this and she basically told me I was retarded so... I probably am. Also, NPR now has a fantastic blog on the linguistic phenomenon that is code-switching, one of their most recent is about an [organically rising creation of the word "yo" as a gender-neutral third-person pronoun](http://www.npr.org/blogs/codeswitch/2013/04/25/178788893/yo-said-what) (in lieu of "he or she"). That blog is great for anyone interested in the cultural, social, economic, and political impact of language. Yesterday, I made potato gnocchi for the first time ever. As far as I know, ironically, this is more a Croatian thing than a Serbian thing (njoki?). I tried to keep it simple. I had a lot of fun poking dimples into the little pieces. The only sauce I added to mine was a light butter sauce. I'm also an idiot and didn't take any photos of it because I was so freakishly hungry by the time I was done. I also had no idea how gnocchi was made, not even sort of, before making this. So it was a fun educational experience. I'd say mine turned out pretty okay. I felt like I undercooked the potatoes just a little but I'm happy that I made it. Hopefully next time I will invite a couple of friends over to try it and tell me it tastes vile and suggest we go eat out :D ![a712be54b3d211e2b13b22000a9e0790_7_by_fartprincess-d63x75o](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/a712be54b3d211e2b13b22000a9e0790_7_by_fartprincess-d63x75o.jpg) **Okay guys, I get it. You love paprika.** When I went to get the potatoes, I noticed something funny... 10 dinar is available here in both paper and coin form. I'm not sure if one is less common than the other. In fact, there is a 20 Dinar coin too and they were introduced in 2003, so... I don't know. I also found out that I was wrong about the 50 para coin. It was introduced in 2000, so it's not being fazed out of circulation--I have seen 1, 2, 5, and 10 Dinar coins so far, but no 50 para. Usually if there is a fraction of a Dinar in change, the cashier won't even bother giving it to you. I've seen this happen in other countries too, so I'm not really surprised or anything. I had noted in Croatia that there was a huge "cash" culture. I don't know if it's more or less present here in Serbia but I have noticed that people are very, very finicky about large bills. I've been scolded more than a couple of times for trying to pay with a 1,000 Dinar bill for something that is 500 Dinar. This is like paying for a $5 item in the US with a $10 bill. But it doesn't seem to happen universally, just in high traffic stores like small groceries. When I went to the palaƒçinkara and paid for what I think was maybe 200 Dinar with a 1000 Dinar bill, the woman didn't seem to give half a shit. However, paying for 1300 with 2000 at Maxi (a medium-sized grocery store)? Outlandish and unheard of. Not forbidden, but if you don't get outright scolded for it, you will get a lot of grumpiness and irritation from the cashier. She might even pull her cash drawer out of the till and explode coins at you as if she were Job from Arrested Development throwing pennies all over the table... or something. ![photo_by_fartprincess-d63x75c](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/photo_by_fartprincess-d63x75c.jpg) **Paper 10 and 10 Coin** It's been weird though. In Croatia, I paid for everything with my bank card. My bank doesn't have any foreign transaction fees, which is fucking awesome. Here I've been using the same cash I took out over a week ago. So... what I'm saying is that it's very cheap here! Something else I have been noticing is that there are a LOT of cats here. Like I will walk by some yard and there will be like 20 cats in one yard. And strays roaming the streets everywhere. There also seem to be a lot of animals in bad condition. This morning, I witnessed a cat running up the street ahead of me. It was running in a hop like a rabbit. I thought it was just the cat's personality but then as I caught up with it I realized one of its front legs was broken completely in half. I felt really sorry for it yet there was nothing I could really do to help. There's also a lot of veterinarians here and they seem to get a lot of business. A few days ago, I saw a very large guy abusing a small dog. It made me really angry but there was nothing I could do to stop it. He was obviously a violent person and it would have been unwise for me to intervene and beyond that, there was no way for me to communicate anyway. It was an isolated incident though--I don't think Belgrade is full of people that beat dogs. But the look on the dog's face really left an impression on me. It looked terrified. I just wanted to run in and take it away and give it to someone who would love it and appreciate it. Blegh.
