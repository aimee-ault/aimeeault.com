# Stockholm, Day 1: A Butt That Won't Quit

Friday, I left Fiumicino Airport, endured a brief and calm layover in Warsaw, Poland, and around 10PM that night, glided over the Stockholm archipelago (Stockholms skärgård) right, getting the breathtaking experience of seeing the sun set over the islands and Baltic Sea.  [ ](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d68da4t.jpg) ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d68da6b](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d68da6b.jpg) Everything is very easy in Stockholm. I have noted before that I felt at "home" in Germany. For many of the same reasons, I feel at home in Sweden as well. Things are very straightforward, uncomplicated, and minimalistic, as they ought to be. The more automated and less time-consuming things are, the better, I think--and the Swedes have certainly made an art of minimalism. For example, when I landed, I figured there was the possibility that the express train was no longer running from the airport to the city center or that I would have to stand in a long line, that it would be crowded, and like many other airport commuter trains, not explicit in which direction it was heading or where I needed to go. You simply cannot fuck up riding the Arlanda Express, however. It runs every 15 minutes and it goes straight to the city center's main train station, which is the final stop. The cherry on top of this, for me, was that the train had free WiFi, and I was able to get some work done in the 25-minute ride into town. Occasionally, I would look up out of the window and realize we were moving very, very swiftly. My Moves iPhone app later informed me that we were traveling at around 200kmph (120mph), impressive. An American friend of mine who I met last summer while in Paris, Mike, lives in Stockholm now, working for Thoughtbot. He was in the process of applying for residency when we met and was spending the time in which he wasn't allowed to enter Sweden going around Europe giving talks on functional programming and stuff like that, so we hung out a bit in Paris and Berlin, and I figured it would be rude of me to come through Europe and not stop by and say "hi" while I'm on my quest for the perfect Swedish meatball and to find the family of my former Klappar Haj shark, Reginald (for some reason, it's funny for me to think of a shark being Swedish... if I had to personify a shark, it'd be like a mix of Californian and Russian). For the weekend, because I arrived earlier than I had planned, I have to stay in a hotel merely a block from the apartment I will be staying in. A lot of people are curious about my arrangements when I travel, where I stay. I usually will either stay with friends or an AirBnB rental--which is a lot cheaper than staying in a hotel and has a less plastic-y vibe. This is the first time I have stayed in a hotel in over a year, and although it is clean and nice, I'm not crazy about it because it feels like a colossal waste of my money (I am very thrifty if that is not obvious; most people don't know that about me). Although the sun set at 10PM, it never gets dark in Sweden in the summer. At 3AM, there is still a glimmer of sunlight in the sky, which is perplexing if you don't draw the curtains and happen to wake up in the middle of the night. I was told that crime is very low in Sweden and I wonder if part of that is due to a general lack of darkness in the months where crime would otherwise be most heavy. 

# Money

The money here is the most interesting thing I have come across so far. Although Sweden is part of the EU, they refuse to adopt the Euro and are still on the Swedish Krona (SEK), which has a 6.66 SEK to USD exchange rate. From what I have read and can surmise, the refusal to switch is more politically inspired than economically. Sweden is legally obligated to switch to the Euro because of a treaty from the 90s, however it is a loosely interpreted document. The Economist published an article a long time ago about all of this, citing that according to an exit poll, the people who voted against the switch the most were in the 18-30 age group and that the decision had little to do with disinterest in Sweden being a part of the EU. The biggest reasons cited for aversion to the Euro were conflicts of interest with democracy and sovereignty. Cost of living is very high in Stockholm. Having spent a lot of time in the Balkans, I thought maybe I was just used to that cost of living, which is very low (You can have a full dinner at a mid-level restaurant in Belgrade for $2 USD). Here, a half-liter bottle of juice will cost you 30 SEK, $4.50 USD. That is absurd. I could understand if the cost were to compensate for import taxes for more exotic flavors (mango juice is widely available here despite being about as far removed from a tropical climate as possible), but these prices are on things like dryck lingon (cranberry juice). The Krona has only 4 coins, fortunately: 1, 2, 5, and 10 (although I have not seen the 2 at all). Although the currency breaks down into cents/öre, but the coins have been fazed out of circulation and so now all purchases made with cash are rounded to the nearest Krona. The process of doing this, although done in many countries, actually has a common name... "Swedish rounding," because it originated here. The 10 is cool because it's made of real gold. The 1 is fascinating to me because it seems to have been frequently redesigned: ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d68dacb](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d68dacb.jpg) But only slight font and scaling changes, nothing dramatic. I think a lot can be said about a country based on the way its currency looks. For example, look at Canadian money. It has kids playing fucking hockey on the back. Swedish paper currency is funny because the 20 bank note has an illustration of a dude riding a bird over the countryside: ![Sweden \(20 Kronor\) back](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/Sweden-20-Kronor-back.jpg)

# Language

Nearly everyone in Stockholm speaks quasi-perfect English, to such an extent that I don't ask someone in advance if they speak it--I just assume that they do. I've noticed that in more northern European countries that people develop American accents for when they speak English. Occasionally, when I was in Croatia and Serbia, you could hear a faint British accent when someone spoke English because they had received instruction via British English in their school days. In other countries though, people seem very self-conscious about this and will adopt the accent of whatever culture they are more interested in, American culture being the "cooler" culture.
