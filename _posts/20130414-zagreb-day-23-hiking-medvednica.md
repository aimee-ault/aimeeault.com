# Zagreb, Day 23: Hiking Medvednica

Today I went hiking with Luka, Davor, and Bruna at Medvednica. I ♥ hiking. It's one of my favorite things in the world to do. And it was nice and warm out today so it was perfect weather for it. The only downside was having to wake up at 9AM for it (again, I go to sleep between 3 and 4AM).  There was a restaurant at the base of the mountain that we met up at. Croatian restaurant culture amuses me because often, there is no menu. You just have to kind of know what there is and order it. I guess it's just assumed that most places have standards like coffee, juice, etc. This isn't really too crazy considering the same mentality applies to US restaurants to some extent. I had no idea what I wanted. Davor kindly stepped in and ordered for me and I ended up with an espresso of some sort. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d61pxu9](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d61pxu9.jpg) It was nice out. Still morning. The sun was shining. There was a nice view down of town below. I had on my super cool "I ♥ Croatia" armband. When I wore my "Proud to be Croat" socks around, I noticed I was getting _a lot of stares_. My sense of fashion is very, very not in tune with the Croats. I don't mind it that much. I have grown used to the weird stares every time I go out in short shorts and thigh high socks. The stares from the socks were a bit different, because people would nudge their friends and point at me. They'd all be smiling and laughing, but it was impossible to tell if the laughter was positive or negative. Every person who talked to me said they liked my socks though and thought they were cool. A group of younger guys saw me when I first went out with them. They weren't extremely young, but younger than me. Maybe early 20s. One of them called out to me and said something but I didn't catch the entire phrase, just the "Dobra" part. I figure it must have been something positive. Given that people here get to walk around with sweatshirts on that say "NEW YORK" on them, I don't think I should get any grief for wearing Croatia socks or silly armbands. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d61pzzd](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d61pzzd.jpg) The hike up was nice except for one point. Despite being boots, the traction of my shoes is horrible. We skipped a detour and everyone else managed to make it across a set of precariously arranged rocks that looked down over a bit of a steep fall down. Even though I am an experienced hiker, I am extremely clumsy. I eventually made my way across with some help. I felt kind of dumb for it, especially since I'm that person who is always climbing things that shouldn't be climbed. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d61q0ue](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d61q0ue.jpg)Luka, Davor, and Bruna checking out the stream. I learned today about how there have been Chinese families that tried to settle into Croatia but got pushed out because they were notorious for selling bad things. I also learned that there are a lot of trails on this mountain! It made me want to go get a bike and ride them. I never feel more real and alive than when I am outside. I know that's a silly thing to say, because who doesn't? I'm not sure what it is, but I sometimes feel like I have more energy inside of me than is normal for someone my age, hence me always walking everywhere. Hence me always feeling a restless need to be in motion. There was a restaurant at the end of the trail. An old dude with his dog were eating. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d61r645](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d61r645.jpg) ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d61r796](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d61r796.jpg)The dog was sweet and came over to our table to rest. This old dude was badass though. I saw him hiking later, and despite the dumb hiking poles, I wanted to high five him. Bruna brought a huge box of candy with her. The candy was coconut with cream inside with a nut. It was really good. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d61r86m](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d61r86m.jpg) ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d61r79m](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d61r79m.jpg) ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d61r79g](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d61r79g.jpg)On the way up, there was a kid walking ahead who clearly did not want to be there. I've noticed when I hear kids speaking Croatian, they sound like children in the Sims games to me. Kids have incredibly expressive tones in their voices. You don't have to even pay attention to what they're saying--it's all in how they deliver it. They have a very incredible way of expressing happiness audibly in a way you won't hear in adults. It's a natural default baseline of happiness. It's not triggered by an event. It's just their nature. Anyway. The rest of the mountain was very pretty too. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d61r78i](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d61r78i.jpg) ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d61r789](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d61r789.jpg)There was snow at the top still. This is 2 week old snow. It wasn't even cold at the top. There were people up there skiing! The lift was on. But I'm pretty sure a lot of it was just powder. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d61r77r](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d61r77r.jpg)Luka explained to me that this is Zagreb's main communication tower, which powers all TV, radio, etc. In the 90s, Serbs took out a huge portion of this tower with rockets. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d61r77h](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d61r77h.jpg)
