# Stockholm, Day 7: I Want the D

![image_by_fartprincess-d694nmj](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/image_by_fartprincess-d694nmj.jpg) Yeah...  My allergies are out. of. control. For me, if you must know, this means combatting a half dozen turbulent fits of what I can only summarize as "torrential hurricane-force rains" emitting from my nose in a whinnying high-pitch fashion. I've had friends comment that this is "adorable" and "cute," so sure, there is... that. I suppose it could be worse and I could sound like a group of dying school children whose flesh is melting off in the face of a hissing out-of-control radiator that is expelling waves of fire. The Spanish word estornudo always seems apt for me because it sounds like tornado kind of (estornudar has a very boring etymology since it descends directly from its Latin roots without much wiggle room in interpretation, although it's funny to even think of anyone talking about sneezing in Latin, but I'm sure Nero wrote a thing or two in his diary about his own sneezes, right?). So yeah. High-pitched winds are a good way of describing it, really. The funny thing is that when I was a kid, I remember watching movies with my friend Janet and "Sneezy" of Los Siete Enanitos was Mocoso, which is like a really sterile yet impolite way of calling someone "snotty" even though literally it's "alguien que tiene mucosidad" (someone who has mucus). There's seemingly no real word for "sneezy" in Spanish, mocoso is as close as it gets even though it doesn't actually mean sneezy... because estornudoso is not a word (though I'd be surprised if no one had ever used their own creative liberty with language to improvise that). And now I'm wondering why we call conceited, arrogant people "snotty." Today, a friend of mine who I forgot lived here (how awkward is that) invited me to go to Eriksdalsbadet, not telling me what that was beforehand. It's described as a "water park," but it's not what I, as an American, think of as a water park. It's a park, yes, with 2 large pools. It was definitely not hot enough to be swimming. It's not cold in Stockholm right now, but it's not very hot either. It's just nice early summer weather. I was told by a British woman I met earlier this week that this was about as much "summer" as Stockholm would probably get this year. She told me that the Swedes love to talk about weather and that this weather was such a pain. I found it ironic coming from a woman who is from London, possibly one of the rainiest cities in the world. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d694bna](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d694bna.jpg) I got to enjoy a nice ice cream and dangle my feet in some water and that's about it as far as my foray into summer took me. I've been here for a week but the way people here describe this weather as nice, I kind of wonder if they spend the rest of the year exiled in an ice palace guarded by snow dogs and shiving each other with icicles over the last Klondike Bar. My natural warm-bloodedness tells me I'm probably not meant to ever live somewhere like this and that I should probably stick to warm climated places, preferably near beaches and heat :) On the way there, I saw this: ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d694cju](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d694cju.jpg) I wondered how this made its way to Stockholm. It's the Zagreb Dinamo's football club. And it made me remember suddenly this giant shift between cultural attitudes from Croatia to Sweden. There is almost no graffiti or tagging to be found in Sweden. It's a very clean place. My friend Mike claims the street-cleaning trucks come through on the weekend (in Europe it's common for trucks with high-pressured hoses to go up and down streets spraying them down to clean them). I have not seen these trucks at all. You'd see them everywhere in Belgrade and yet Belgrade was still very, very dirty. Sweden has some plazas that are littered, but it doesn't get much worse than that. At first glance, I thought the Swedes were just very clean or were just nicer people. At a closer inspection, I don't think that's the case. I won't make sweeping generalizations about all Swedes, but I have seen plenty of counterexamples. For example, it is very common for people here to spit on the ground a lot. I've heard from friends who have been that this is really common in China as well, that it's just one person after the next hocking phlegmy loogies all over the ground, walls, anywhere... because they consider keeping it in to be unclean, and to carry around tissues in your pocket to be disgusting. So I sense a bit of that here as well. You get it in America too, especially the snot rocketing (closing one nostril and blowing to the ground) which is gross to watch, but... yeah. Anyway. I think I will be happy to leave here. I'm going to Amsterdam on Monday for a few days. After that, I will be spending next weekend in London, having invited Dom to take the train down to come hang out with me. And after that, I am taking a train down to Brighton for a few days, to give myself some time away from civilization to do some much-needed writing. I'll then be flying back to America on the 28th/29th. I initially thought my return was "overdue," but that's not really a correct assessment. I just need to be in one spot for more than a few days. I was fine when I was in Croatia and Serbia. Since then, it has been constant stop and go... one of the things I am always telling people is that I like to "live" wherever I visit. I don't like being a tourist. I like learning the language especially. And seeing it as locals see it. One week in each place is just not enough time to even sort of get anything like that. Ideally, I would stay in each place I visit anywhere from 3-8 weeks, if not longer. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d694du6](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d694du6.jpg) ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d694dya](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d694dya.jpg) I'm also excited because I found out that one of my friends back in the US who works at the Texas School for the Blind is assisting with video production on some sort of ASL documentation and wanted to talk to me some about a web application I've been working on for showing regional variance in sign languages (I'm about to beta-launch my app and still looking for good beta testers.... so, calling all nerds, calling all nerds, if you want in, please contact me). I'm primarily looking for either deaf users, people who are proficient signers (who sign in the home, are related, close friends with, or married to a deaf person), or professional linguists whose work constellates around nonverbal language. At least for a first pass. The app is intended to serve as a language learning tool, but I know that it would also be beneficial to the deaf community as well to provide a record of a language that is constantly ebbing and flowing in the hands (literally) of the community.
