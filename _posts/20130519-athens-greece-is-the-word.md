# Athens: Greece is the Word

Friday, I got on a plane in Belgrade and flew south to Greece. I was there just for the weekend, staying in a quaint little studio hosted by some very nice Greek dude. One backpack of stuff slapped together in 10 minutes and I was ready.    ![fec861b2bee011e281d622000a1f975c_7](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/fec861b2bee011e281d622000a1f975c_7.jpg) **I have a new goal. I want to get this bag plastered in badges from the places I visit. It's been a good travel bag. It deserves that honor.** Everything started off interestingly. I was sitting at my kitchen table in Belgrade, getting work done for the day, when suddenly 15 minutes before I was supposed to leave, the power went out for my entire floor. I said, "fuck it," closed my laptop, threw it into my already packed backpack, the only thing I brought with me, and walked outside to catch a cab to the airport. The cab that showed up was driven by this insanely hot Serb dude who looked like an Italian Ryan Gosling, who would occasionally look back at me through the rearview through his aviators, saying very concise statements and questions. As we reached the airport, he quoted me my fare in Euros and I was caught off-guard because I didn't have any Euro on me and I didn't know how much it was in Dinar. He said, "One Euro is about 110 Dinar." I misheard him and thought he was telling me the fare was 110 Dinar, so I handed him that and he said, "This is 1 Euro." I suddenly felt very flustered and embarrassed at the fact that I couldn't seem to do basic math in front of Serbian Ryan Gosling, so I handed him a bunch of Dinar in a very clumsy oafish manner and he laughed suddenly and said, "Okay, bye bye." **And so the adventure began.** The airport in Belgrade is really something. It's named Nikola Tesla Airport and yet the technology contained within is so antiquated in a vey cutesy manner. The flight arrivals/departures boards were not digital. And it is a very small airport. As I passed through the security check, the guy working saw my Mortal Kombat pin on my backpack, something I got from PAX in 2010 for playtesting Mortal Kombat 9 (I know, everyone is thinking, "Mortal Kombat 9?", and: yes.) He reacted to it by yelling out, "Mortal Kombat!" I replied, "Da!" It was like we were going to high-five at this point, but he suddenly got very cool on me and said in this awesome cool guy voice, "Sub-Zero. Win." And I laughed. ![5121cb80bee411e284b222000a1fbcf6_7_by_fartprincess-d65pj0r](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/5121cb80bee411e284b222000a1fbcf6_7_by_fartprincess-d65pj0r.jpg) ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d65om9j](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d65om9j.jpg) The flight left and immediately after ascending, the pilot informed us that we should absolutely, under no circumstances, unbuckle our seat belts. Right after he said this, the plane dipped what felt like several hundred feet. People were screaming and gripping onto their seats. I took a really deep breath, and then lulled back into my seat and read a bit of Jack Kerouac's On the Road. I've read Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance but oddly never On the Road. Something I read in the book really resonated with me: 

> “I woke up as the sun was reddening; and that was the one distinct time in my life, the strangest moment of all, when I didn't know who I was - I was far away from home, haunted and tired with travel, in a cheap hotel room I'd never seen, hearing the hiss of steam outside, and the creak of the old wood of the hotel, and footsteps upstairs, and all the sad sounds, and I looked at the cracked high ceiling and really didn't know who I was for about fifteen strange seconds. I wasn't scared; I was just somebody else, some stranger, and my whole life was a haunted life, the life of a ghost.”

That's how I feel all the time! To anyone who doesn't know this life, it sounds negative, to be a ghost. But it's not. It's not something I celebrate either, am merely ambivalent about. It's the feeling that you know as you see more and more, that it grows within you and with that, the world and by association, all of its problems become more comprehensible and thereby all the minor, trivial things around you seem like nothing at all. And it all happens so fast, so quickly, that you don't have a moment to spare to analyze yourself in the situation. You are constantly running and doing something. It's a very astounding thing for me. When I first stayed in Paris a year ago on my own, I had a moment where I arrived at my host's flat and couldn't get inside and I was enveloped in a shroud of all my fears. And I thought, "Fuck I'm going to have to get on a plane and go home." But there was no home. There was just these moments to conquer. Now I can never feel that way again, because I know I lived through it. I'm no longer scared. As Mitch Hedberg once jokingly said, "I'm sick of following my dreams. I'm just going to ask them where they're goin', and hook up with them later." If you have a dream, you don't need to follow it. If you're doing what's right for you, you'll get there regardless. It'll follow you. The plane started to descend and all of these islands came into view. The water was bright blue. And then we were there. I was thankful I didn't pack anything other than my backpack because I was able to just leave the airport. I took the Metro from the airport. The only thing I knew was that I needed to get to Syntagma Square. The Metro has 4 lines in Athens, the blue one runs straight from the airport to Syntagma. It's a 45 minute ride. I was awkwardly sitting there charging my phone battery with my laptop. A woman got on and was crying, but only subtly. A man sitting across from me kept making eye contact with me. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d65om61](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d65om61.jpg) As soon as I got out of the train and out into the square, it hit me that I was in a very different place from anywhere I have ever been. I immediately was channeling this old THQ action RPG I played in my early 20s, Titan Quest. The palm trees. The marble terraces. The spell-casting bog dwellers. The stairs leading up from the Metro exit out of the square were filled with kids who were breakdancing to this music I've never heard anything like other than to say I recognized that it had cowbell in it. And it did not need more cowbell. A kid that looked like he was maybe 7 years old was smoking a cigarette in the most carefree manner imaginable. Like he was a seasoned smoker and had been doing it since age 4. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d65okuz](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d65okuz.jpg)
