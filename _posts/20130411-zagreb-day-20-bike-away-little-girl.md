# Zagreb, Day 20: Bike Away, Little Girl

Today I rented a bike in Zagreb. Hopefully it was just the one bike rental store I was at, but there was only one women's bike and I didn't want it! There was also only one road bike (it was not the women's bike). The man told me over and over again, pointing at the women's bike (a mountain bike) that, "THIS IS THE BIKE YOU WANT."  I very adamantly said, "No, I really don't think it is!" and asked if he had any other bikes that were my size. I'm small (5'3"/160cm), so unlike other women who can often get away with riding a men's road bike, I typically have to stick to WSDs. The only two companies I know of that make adequate WSDs are Specialized and Cannon though, so they're hard to come by internationally, which is probably why so many women stick to cutesy little commuter bikes. The bike I ended up with was a men's road bike made by Giant, which is a Taiwanese bike company that I don't know much about (I'd heard the name before). Amusingly, in front of the road bike there was a little tiny girly tricycle parked and I at first thought the shop owner was insinuating that that was the only other bike that would work for me, the girly tricycle with pink froo-froo streamers. He reluctantly adjusted the seat on the men's road bike, lower and lower. I knew the frame was much too large. Finding the right fit on a road bike can be tough. You don't want your feet to be able to touch the ground while sitting on it. A lot of people make that mistake. He eventually lowered it to the very bottom of the seat post and my legs still had about half an inch of clearance from the ground. I said, "Okay, I'll make do with this." I sometimes say very American idioms with non-native speakers. I usually will think about it about 20 seconds after the fact and silently wonder if they knew what I meant or if they just chose to ignore it and treat it as filler speech. Once out of the store, I realized what I was in for. I have disproportionately long legs. I can wear pants that are marked as "long" even though I am very short. Consequently, my torso is small. So while my legs fit the bike just fine, I struggled to reach the handlebars. Oops. The bike just felt overwhelmingly large for me in general. But the rental was fairly cheap (100 kuna) and they didn't really seem to have much concern over liability. They didn't want my passport number or any other identifying information. I handed them my Oregon driver's license which has an out of date address on it. Theoretically, I could steal this bike and there would be very little they could do about it. I have no idea what happened to this picture, but I love it (**Fun Fact!** Did you know I played the part of Samara from the movie, The Ring? Me neither.) ![samira_by_fartprincess-d61b1rf](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/samira_by_fartprincess-d61b1rf.jpg) ![bike_by_fartprincess-d61b1xb](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/bike_by_fartprincess-d61b1xb.jpg) Anyway. Zagreb has a very, very, very different cycling culture from America. I am used to living in very bike-friendly places where the community's urban planning caters to cyclists. Zagreb does not seem to really give much thought to cyclists. They are bottom of the chain, at least comparably to my own experiences elsewhere in the world. First, here, you don't ride on the road. You ride on the sidewalk. With pedestrians. There are designated bike lanes but they are in this red paint that is almost entirely faded out throughout most of the city and most pedestrians walk in that space anyway. Riding a bike means weaving in and out of pedestrians. As someone who lives as a dual cyclist and pedestrian, I don't think bicycles and pedestrians belong in the same space. It's dangerous for both parties, especially when the sidewalks are as narrow as they are on some streets here... especially when you are near tram stops around rush hour. It just seems like a disaster waiting to happen. A couple of days ago, I was walking downtown when someone hit me with their bike. Today, I almost had a head-on collision with another bike. I have to admit that the near-collision was comical. I made a yelping, "EEEEE" and the guy made a face I've only seen from the Three Stooges. It made me miss my bike a little though. It's amusing in some way. I've never had much personal attachment to objects. I did have a little bit of attachment to my last road bike, "Bradford D. Bike" (the D stands for Danger), however once that was stolen and once I got to Austin, I purchased another road bike, which ended up taking the name "Kendra Scott" (after some store on South Congress Street). I have a lot of memories with this bike, but I don't feel any material attachment to it. My sentimental attachment is more to the experiences I have, not so much the vessels or implements that constructed them. 

# Jarun & Skate Park

I biked around Jarun, which is both a lake and a neighborhood, with a friend. Jarun was nice. It was sunny. And there were people running around in shorts. But most interesting to me was that there was a skate park: ![skateprk_by_fartprincess-d61b67i](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/skateprk_by_fartprincess-d61b67i.jpg) So the most notable thing to me about this was that there was a distinct lack of skateboarding. Everyone here was on inline skates This is hard for me to comment on because I grew up immersed in both skate cultures. Ironically, I suck at skateboarding today and had a very unfortunate and bloody accident when I tried out for roller derby. So I know what goes into both. Yet I tend to have more respect for those on the board. Doing a trick and landing it is harder, I think, and I've never seen some aggro inline skater do a trick that a guy on a board couldn't do. There were a couple of kids here on trick bikes though and that really impressed me. One kid rocked a manual on the lip of a quarter pipe on his trick bike for like 5 seconds or something crazy. On my way back from Zlatni Medo (in which I had pohani pileć [breaded chicken, fancy as hell, I know] and a 5 kuna toothbrush from the bathroom wall), Luka texted me asking me if I had any interest going to a Tweetup later, which I of course said, "hell yes" to (I actually said something much milder, like "sure"). I had no idea what a Tweetup would be like but a couple of hours later, Luka picked me up with a friend of his who I think follows me on Twitter. There are a lot of people here with the same first name, Tomislav, so I wasn't totally sure. Every time I hear the name, I just think of the Heavy in Team Fortress 2 :) I met a few really nice people though! ![cevapi_by_fartprincess-d61b1ws](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/cevapi_by_fartprincess-d61b1ws.jpg) This was the ćevapi place we went to first, Pečenjara Zen. Everyone that attends this meeting thinks this place is mediocre, but they keep going out of tradition :D Everyone was drinking lemonade. I don't know why. I also ordered the lemonade. It was okay. Not great. Not bad. ![limunada_by_fartprincess-d61b1ud](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/limunada_by_fartprincess-d61b1ud.jpg)
