# London, Day 3

Yesterday was incredible. I told Dom that I wanted to visit Hyde Park. I was curious to see what kind of crazy people were out at Speakers Corner. The park is quite big, however. It's only half the size of Central Park, but still not something you could have any reasonable expectation of exploring in anything short of a few hours. The ironic part is that it is a short walk to Speakers Corner from my flat, but, having never been there and having no awareness of it really, Dom directed us towards the Tube, where we rode the Circle Line for like 3 stops to get off at the south-west end of the park, putting us about as far from Speakers Corner as you could get.  The park seems more organically maintained than other parks in similar-sized cities. I mostly make comparisons to NYC because I have spent a considerable amount of time there, but Central Park has much more landscape development. Lots of split pedestrian and bike tracks. Hyde Park has quite a bit of the same but it's not plotted as thoroughly. The park has the Serpentine in the middle, which is, to my disappointment, not a treacherous dank lair of writhing snakes where naysayers are thrown to be sacrificed, but rather a quaint little lake where people ride paddle boats and yell profanities at geese. Speakers Corner is in the north-eastern corner of the park and is where people go to stand on little step stools and spout out their ideas to crowds of enthralled spectators. These aren't so much monologues as they are invitations for a challenger to emerge and engage in a lively discussion. However, from what I experienced, the only sturdy platform many of these speakers had was the step stool they were standing on--no leg to stand on whatsoever. But, see, I don't think that matters. I think it's more fun to argue an unpopular side. A good debater can argue for something they don't personally agree with if they know what they are doing and have a strong awareness of logic and fallacy. It's like math. You can memorize formulas all you want, but that's just using your rote memory. If you understand the logic behind it, you are better equipped to understand it in other contexts and explain it to others without driving home the same tired points which you innately do not understand. But debating with many people at once is difficult. It's your mental capabilities against that of 50 others. And some of the speakers are not prepared for the expectation that they will need to be able to really ground their points, so they stall by making it personal and attacking their audience with name-calling or judgments made on physical appearance. I was really surprised when Dom engaged with one of the speakers, Lady Diana. She was a xenophobe, arguing that foreigners should leave England. Dom decided to butt in after she started calling a small child a moron. Some of her favorite responses were "shut your mouth" and "shut up." And of course the whole bit about how on hearing that "Jesus preached 'love thy neighbor'," concluding that "that's a lie." Something about it made me remember my education in South Carolina where my AP US History teacher got really miffed one time at the idea of anyone denying Jesus Christ as a historical figure. I don't think it was what she intended, but from that point on, I very abruptly realized I should really be looking for evidence in every fact presented to me. Lady Diana is appealing because she's one of the few not solely going on about how everyone is going to hell, yet she is probably one of the weakest arguers in the park, which is sad because she's the only woman speaking up and yet she falls into all the tropes of being a woman, getting too emotionally invested in her subject, authoritatively commanding respect in exchange for her seniority, and trying to call attention to her gender by indirectly and spuriously asserting sexist intent with certain words as a way of diverting from her failed points. After listening to all of this, we got bikes from the bikeshare rack. London's bike share is much like other large European cities, but you can rent any number of bikes from the rack using a bank card. The ride is free under 30 minutes and the brakes are practically non-existent. There are two models of bikeshare bikes that I have seen around globally. One is a long coaster style with a fork consisting of two thin tubes--seen in Barcelona and Stockholm. The other is a huge unwieldy mass of metal, seen in Paris and London. The latter is very comfortable but difficult for someone petite like myself to maneuver. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d6afpgf](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d6afpgf.jpg) I think I'm wearing my bike helmet the wrong way :( Of all the cities for me to pick up a bike in, London has to be the funniest place, I suppose. Because of course, bike law, like driving law, dictates that I ride on the left side of the road. This sounds like a very simple concept, but to actually do it feels like you are abandoning your geospatial awareness of the world and accepting that for all you know, the road could just enter into a complex wormhole in the next 100 meters and that everything ahead of you is just a projection of image that you have hallucinated. From this reasoning, I have concluded that my brain already thinks weird enough thoughts while sober that I should definitely stay away from drugs. The bike ride took us back down to the southwestern section of the park where all of the museums were, the one we went in being the Natural History Museum, which reminded me of New York's Natural History Museum. The theme of this visit is me making a lot of comparisons between London and New York. I might be blind to say it, but I think once you look past superficial differences, they are both cities that are thriving on the same principle of booming mass media and serving as an ethnic melting pot. The museum was cool. It has a very anticlimactic escalator that takes you through the glowing ember molten core of a planet and just as soon as you are stopping to wonder, “Why didn't my skin melt off as I passed through the high-pressure mantle?,” you are expelled from the rectum of the planet back into a rather banal sector of the museum attributed to various sediment formations and assorted geology nerd junk. The point of this part of the museum was to touch as much stuff as possible (and for me, put my mouth on stuff… because despite as intelligently as I may present myself in written form, I am actually quite retarded in reality). ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d6afpu6](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d6afpu6.jpg) I should note that I was walking around taking photos on a tablet. I was doing it to be purely ironic, I swear. The most important thing I learned from the Natural History Museum is that the reason ArtBIT is not Superman is because they recently uncovered kryptonite in Serbia. That is, kryptonite was a completely fictitious substance. And scientists uncovered it there and it had the same formula as the fictitious compound (sodium lithium boron silicate hydroxide with fluorine). I should note that this placard is erroneous because the actual substance is not called kryptonite but rather jadarite.
