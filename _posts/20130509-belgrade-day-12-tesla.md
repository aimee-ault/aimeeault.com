# Belgrade, Day 12: Tesla

Yesterday, I went to the Nikola Tesla museum, which is supposedly the Tesla museum. When he died, he left all of his belongings to his nephew and his nephew donated all of it to the museum.  This museum had all of his various diplomas. Tesla received 56 diplomas in his lifetime. That's ridiculous. And that's not even including his potty-training graduation diploma or the one he got for graduating pre-school :D. There's something that grates on me about the pageantry and ostentation of diplomas. I think around the world, and plenty of people think the same, that higher education is completely overrated. Some of the most brilliant people I know never went to college. Nothing will stand in the way of a true intellectual learning and succeeding. And sometimes people have mind-boggling levels of perspicacity that simply cannot evolve in academic settings. I went to college and yet I think everything I know that matters to me, I learned outside of the classroom. Nothing wrong with Tesla though. He's long gone and he was a genius and so I guess his 56 diplomas worked out for him. But I'm not impressed by that--I'm impressed by what he did. I knew plenty about Tesla's work visiting but I didn't really know much about his biographical background. People say he was Serbian-American and I always assumed that meant he was originally from Serbia, but he was actually from a part of Austria that is now Croatia. His parents were Serbs, though. The one thing everyone loves is the Tesla coil machine which transmits electricity wirelessly. I'd first seen one in California at Griffith Observatory but it was all locked up behind this glass case and was underwhelming, I thought. This one was awesome because I got to actually hold the lamp that was being powered by the coil :) And I got to hear the long backstory of Tesla's Wardenclyffe Tower and how J.P. Morgan screwed the world out of free energy. I don't normally like being on museum tours but this is one of those times where I really enjoyed it because I ended up learning a lot about Tesla. The tour guide conveniently did not mention the whole thing about his pigeon wife who he was in love with, however. Understandably, I guess, but I thought it would have been funny. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d64mhao](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d64mhao.jpg) This was the smaller coil. The one next to it was about 12 feet tall and could power the whole room I also got to see a live demonstration of his induction motors, the more popular one everyone knows as the Egg of Columbus, which shows off how rotating magnetic fields work. Egg of Columbus is also an English idiom meaning "a brilliant idea or discovery that seems simple or easy after the fact." I have never used this expression in my life. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d64mh9c](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d64mh9c.jpg) ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d64mh8v](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d64mh8v.jpg) ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d64mh9w](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d64mh9w.jpg) Hahaha. This is funnier in English than I think anyone here is aware of. I also got to see important stuff, like, you know, his butter knife. And his hat. I thought it was an anticlimactic way to end a tour, until the woman led us to a dark room and showed us this golden sphere on a pedestal. It was Tesla's ashes! ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d64mh5g](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d64mh5g.jpg) The crazy thing about this is that Tesla was actually buried in the United States. He died in Manhattan. They then exhumed his body, for reasons no one understands (according to the tour guide) and then cremated him and brought him to Belgrade. I sometimes wonder if there will ever be this gap in history in which future civilization will not understand the concept of urns and human cremation. I know the answer to that is a blunt "no" but I like to entertain the thought of that hypothetical. Maybe it's because I'm here in this culture that has intricacies that I do not always immediately understand, so I think of all the different ways something could be perceived. 

# Other Stuff

On the way home, I stopped into Mini Maxi to pick up milk. One thing I keep noticing in grocery stores here is that the cashier keep touching these little foam pads. I didn't see this in Croatia or anywhere else I've been. I think it's just either a moistening agent or an anti-static foam to help them open plastic bags, which is very mundane, but I just thought it was interesting because it seems to be a Serbia thing and every grocery store has them. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d64mhbg](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d64mhbg.jpg) One of my friends gave me a bottle of local rakija. It's pear-flavored. Actually, no. It's not. It's burning-flavored with a hint of pear. It's good but I couldn't drink that stuff with any frequency that would make me ever want a bottle of this stuff more than once every 10 years. ![511a743cb80b11e29ca422000a1fb149_7_by_fartprincess-d64mhvq](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/511a743cb80b11e29ca422000a1fb149_7_by_fartprincess-d64mhvq.jpg) I thought it was a nice gesture though. I posted it on Instagram under the hash tag "smrt." Which means "death." Because that seems apt, right? I keep seeing these around. They remind me of the car from Ghostbusters: ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d64mh8a](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d64mh8a.jpg) I think that says БЕЛА ЦРКВA. I know both of those words separately, "white" and "church", but I don't know what that has to do with anything, or maybe I am misreading it. The font is really throwing me off because I'm not used to seeing cyrillic in that weird rounded font (I'll laugh if that actually is Segoe UI, which I was going on about yesterday). I don't know if this is an EMS vehicle or just an on-call doctor. I'd think given the size of it and lack of supplies inside that there is no way it could be an EMS vehicle. I passed by the give/take wall again. I'm not going to keep writing about all the shit I see there. I pass by it every single day. But yesterday I saw this there and it made me laugh a lot: ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d64mh7l](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d64mh7l.jpg) Yes, I really need Ace Service documentation from 11 years ago.
