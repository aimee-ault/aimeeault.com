# Amsterdam, Day 1

Today I am in Amsterdam, Holland. Of what I have seen so far, the culture here is quite spellbinding. My hosts, a couple of developers, informed that if I wanted to take the "scenic route", to take the train from the airport to Amsterdam Centraal instead of RAI. I was going to just take the RAI because I needed to get in so I could get some work done, but a very irate train director on the platforms was yelling at people and I found it very distracting, so I ended up missing that train and taking the one to Centraal.  On the way there, I was looking out the window thinking, "What on earth is scenic about this?" I mean, sure there was a scene. It was just a scene of construction and highway. Then when I got off, I found out. Basically, the Centraal takes you further out than the RAI. So at both stations, you get on the same exact tram, the 4, but the Centraal is... further out. You get to see all of central Amsterdam on the tram ride. Amsterdam's tram is the most unique of all I've seen in my travels. Each car has an attendant booth inside of it. So this is essentially like having an on-site fare validator around-the-clock who also sells tickets. The guy in my tram looked like an odd hybrid of Morgan Freeman and Mr. Hooper from Sesame Street, so naturally, I asked him to explain the tram system to me for a large portion of the ride with the expectation that he would narrate it with Morgan Freeman's candidly calm demeanor, which, surprisingly, he did. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d69jtae](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d69jtae.jpg) When you get on the tram, even if you buy a ticket from this guy, you have to validate it with the machine right in front of him. The kicker is that you are supposed to "check out" of the tram when you get off by using the machine a second time. The preachy intercom announcements will prate on and on about how important it is that you do, not because you'll get taken to TRAM PRISON or anything uniquely amusing, but that your ticket will become invalid if you attempt to transfer to another tram or bus, so says Mr. Freeman's doppelgänger. As I suspected from seeing all the pictures, Amsterdam is one of the most bicycle-friendly cities in the world. Over 60% of rides taken in the inner city are done by bicycle and the bike racks, which are endless, are really not even possible to see. They're just giant rat nests of bikes piled atop one another. I can't imagine what you would do if your bike were inside the rack and you needed to get somewhere because it seems like people lock their bikes to other people's bikes. Oddly, Amsterdam does not have a simplified (read: government-subsidized monopoly) bikeshare program (yet). The popularity of bikes is understandable though if you look at the way Amsterdam, Venice of the north, is structured. From the center of the city, it stretches out in several rings of canals that are tied together with historical cobblestone road. Even the more major roads that pass over the canals have enormous buffered bike tracks on both sides which are given priority over pedestrian sidewalks. So it's a hard city to be a pedestrian in... but not because of cars. Because of bikes. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d69jvfw](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d69jvfw.jpg) I got in very late and after getting some work done, realized how late it was. I went to a place called The Butcher which featured several burgers which sounded like Diablo II bosses. After slaying Baal in my skimpy barbarian breastplate, I began chatting with the owners. The place was run by two guys from Côte d'Ivoire, one who was an electrician and was asking me a ton of questions about the US when I kept asking questions about the ivory coast (I mean when will be the next time I meet someone from there? I need to know everything!). A guy and a girl were eating while I waited for my food. They were speaking English but neither sounded like it was their native language. I could tell especially with the girl because she would sometimes pause and give very sudden emphasis to a popular phrase much like someone would do when they code switch from another language, saying a bunch of stuff very swiftly, only to abruptly slow down as they say "fuck off." A friend of the girl showed up and was suddenly asking if they were going to go smoke. It was implicitly understood exactly what was going to be smoked--the entire city smells looms under a cloud of smoke from all the marijuana (I'm honestly not sure if my hosts' flat smells like pot or patchouli) This morning, when I went to get some breakfast, I saw this: ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d69jwia](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d69jwia.jpg) As you pass by it, you feel a strong gust of wind followed by a long euphonious farting sound. One of the eyes winks at you.  I started laughing. As it turns out, the people who own these "statues" are a group of deviants and I explained to them that my username on deviantART is "fartprincess," and we all had a good laugh and they said it was fate that brought me here to this one statue, to get farted on by the ultimate fart princess. Being here is proving to be interesting because the language has many similarities to German. If I am listening in on someone's conversation, I generally can't understand what they are saying because it sounds very different, but in writing, I can immediately understand what something says because the spelling is so similar (waarom vs. warum, for example). Curious to see how being immersed in so many languages has affected me, I started  talking to some people online in Esperanto yesterday in an Esperanto group that I am part of. It had been a few years since I had last spoken it and I had started studying it again in January, but traveling obviously forced me to put it aside in favor of other languages. Now, it comes to me very easily because I have a much stronger understanding of language roots and in comparison to the grammars of many natural languages I have exposed myself to, it's so easy. So you might say mi sentas fiera (I feel proud!). And of course, seeing "senti" (much like Spanish and French's "sentir"), it brings meaning to English words like "sensation." It's funny. I can't ever imagine myself getting burnt out on language. It seems to go hand in hand with writing. Every time I learn a bit of something new about a language, whether it is grammar or vocabulary, or simply broader social subjects like language economy and how it scales with technology, it really shapes how I play with words otherwise and how I perceive other people's speech.
