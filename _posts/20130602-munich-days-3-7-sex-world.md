# Munich, Days 3-7: Sex World

I've been in München, Deutschland for the past week. I haven't gotten lazy with my journals, however. I just simply felt different about my stay here than what I experienced in Zagreb and Beograd. But I'm leaving tomorrow to move on to Italy, so I feel like I should write a tiny recap! In Munich, I feel a sense of comfort and belonging. It is a culture I know and rather than feel like a sidelined note-taking spectator, I felt inclusive to the culture, like I was a part of it. That's not to say I felt completely like an outsider in the Balkans--not at all. But in that case, it took conscientious effort for me to fit in and even then, I had no internal feeling that I was really "making it." I met many friends in the Balkans who I got along well with, but in a general fashion, I think I left the Balkans with a general air of, "there goes the American."  But here, there was no galvanized effort to fit in--I just did. But it was a weird time because well, it rained the entire week I was here. And not just drizzle. But downpours. This didn't stop me from going out but it did make taking pictures of it all very difficult because: 

  1. Everything was gray.
  2. I didn't take my DSLR with me anywhere because I didn't want it to get wet
  3. My iPhone's camera kept getting condensation in the lens from the rain which made many photos I took look like they were taken inside of a sauna.

# Food

The food was the highlight of my stay here. Aside from a brunch or two at cafes, I spent most of my dinners at assorted Biergärten and traditional restaurants. The best I found was Augustine-Keller. I went in and it felt like I was lost in a mead hall from Monkey Island, or to be more literary, Beowulf. Everyone was watching the Bayern Munich - Stuttgart game. A guy was dressed in a full Mario costume. A dog laid on the floor, barking and its ears perking up every time the crowd cheered. Steins filled with local beer clinked together euphoniously alongside gleeful applause as Bayern Munich won the game 3-2 in a very tense shootout. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d67iimn](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d67iimn.jpg) ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d67iir4](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d67iir4.jpg) I also went to Nero, a pizza place in my neighborhood popular amongst locals. It was a communal seating area, again like a beer hall or garden, but it was a trattoria and it was busy. I ended up getting seated in a small section without communal dining. I anticipated eating all alone and just sort of absorbing the atmosphere, but the waiter ended up hanging out with me and talking to me a lot, telling me how he thought I was "very brave" and how he worries that his German isn't great enough (he was Italian) and how much he prefers Latin-based language. I felt sort of like a drowned rat in Munich, my hair wet, wearing layers of damp clothing, and yet everyone's attitude towards me here made me feel more attractive than I have in a while--having someone ask me out on a date despite the fact that I think I smell and look like a hobo in that particular moment :). Part of that is what made me feel like I fit in, though. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d67iip0](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d67iip0.jpg) ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d67iip8](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d67iip8.jpg) In one of the places I ate, I had the unusual experience of, after ordering veal wienershchnitzel, having an Asian lady get up from her table, walk over to mine, and ask me to explain to her what veal was. I said, "Oh, it's like a sweet little baby cow who hasn't even developed its leg muscles yet, so little he can't even utter out a moo sufficiently." She walked back to her table and I was sure there was no way she was going to order veal at that point, but she pointed over to my table and said, "I will have that baby cow." I then got to listen in on a very amusingly labored conversation between two people using English as a medium. One of them speaking Mandarin as her native tongue, the other German. They made it work, though. I found that the speed of service was completely unpredictable here, usually leaning on whatever was most unlucky for me. On Tuesday night, the DreamUp team launched a new feature. I said on a Skype call at 8PM, "Mind waiting a couple of hours? I haven't had dinner yet." I paid dearly for that. I returned at 11:30PM. This is where my work life and personal life get funny. I was on a call with Sasha and Andrew last week in which they remarked that it's impressive that I'm able to travel like I do and work just as well as I would if I were home. And I had commented to them that it takes a lot of discipline and knowing your boundaries. For example, never staying somewhere if I think the Internet might be flakey. And well... knowing that if I come back from dinner at 11:30PM, I'm probably going to be up until 5AM if I am supposed to launch something that day :) It's all good though. It makes for interesting stories later on, even if I have to apologize to my project manner Elisa the next day for being a complete fussbudget at 3AM. 

# Language and Art

I went to Haus der Kunst on Saturday. They had work by Mel Bochner (the American artist) on display. Bochner is a man after my own heart. His work is conceptual pieces that focus around language and color. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d67iin7](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d67iin7.jpg) The funny thing about visiting this exhibit was that I was wearing this t-shirt: ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d67iiq1](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d67iiq1.jpg) I had just come from a cafe near Isartor where the waitress was extremely friendly to me yet I felt like every time she approached me, laid back in my seat, that the shirt's words were the first things communicated to her. I like vulgarity, but it was probably the first time ever in my life where I've felt like I didn't want these words doing the speaking for me. Not that I thought she took it as a personal statement to her, but that I just felt bad in some way, like I wanted to apologize. Likewise, at the exhibit, I thought, "What if they don't let me in because my shirt is offensive to them?" then I walked inside and saw Bochner's piece on insults that said "GO FUCK YOURSELF" and I laughed. Seeing the words all juxtaposed next to each other got me excited to write more, especially when I got to his piece on lewdness, where I saw "triple-X-rated" next to "fetid." 

# Triple-X-Rated

Speaking of lewd, I went into: ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d67iirw](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d67iirw.jpg)
