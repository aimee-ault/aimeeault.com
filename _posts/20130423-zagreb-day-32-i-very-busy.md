# Zagreb, Day 32: I VERY BUSY

Every few days, I record this sign language video log I've been doing for a little while now. The idea was to consistently force myself to give a 5-10-minute monologue so that I have to practice ASL. I just talk about things going on in my life, nothing that interesting. But I enjoy doing the vlogs because it gives me a chance to speak for a different bit of my personality, more simplistic, less refined. But the videos all start the same: "I VERY BUSY."  And I am. And for now, I like being that way, because as tiring as it is, there comes great peace with exhaustion. Having purpose is important. When you start to doubt yourself, the real world will eat you alive. I have an endless supply of purpose that keeps me walking. Some people wonder why and how. I never do. But this morning I felt like this: ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d62rt6t](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d62rt6t.jpg) Before getting some work done, I took a trip to the last museum on my list, the Archeology Museum. This was actually a pretty fascinating museum, given that Croatia is geographically close to a lot of very primitive civilizations. Interestingly, I learned that the Roman merchants had absolutely no interest whatsoever in colonizing the land where Zagreb now sits because they failed to see the opportunity for substantial economic growth in the area. The museum had a lot to offer, like amputated mummified foot: ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d62ru58](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d62ru58.jpg) I'm not sure how I would feel if my foot, just my foot, ended up in a museum. I always tell people if I die, I want my body to be donated to science. But the joke is that when you donate your body to science, well, one of those students has to get an 'F' Someone just wasn't cut for the job and they learned their weakness through your dead body. Coming to you from 1998, here was the oldest thing in the museum, in my opinion: ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d62rv9h](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d62rv9h.jpg) ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d62rw93](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d62rw93.jpg) At one point, the museum had a box full of different spices, 8 total. You could stick your hand straight into the little boxes and pull out clumps of mint or sage if you wanted. Why would you. Who has never experienced poppy seed before? There's this "joke" on The Simpsons where Martin the nerd says, "Here's a tip, put a pinch of sage in your boots and all day long a spicy scent is your reward." Who has two boots full of stolen sage and feels like a moron? ![screen_shot_2013_04_23_at_6_36_37_pm_by_fartprincess-d62rvw2](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/screen_shot_2013_04_23_at_6_36_37_pm_by_fartprincess-d62rvw2.png) Museums here all have guestbooks. American museums do not have guestbooks. As an American, can you imagine how confusing this made the Internet for me in the 1990s? Navigating to my friend's Mr. T Ate My Balls website, jamming out to their MIDI of November Rain, and wondering what the fuck Dreambook was and why Iceman77 was leaving a comment in it. I like the concept of guestbooks here because I can anonymously leave nice messages for strangers. I'll write a lot more tomorrow. I'm just too exhausted to write anything more meaningful today, let alone something profoundly deep and intelligent. Before I end this, however, I feel it's my obligation to let all the Croats know that Americans do not eat hot dogs in jars like this: ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d62rym0](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d62rym0.jpg) This is not the American Way.
