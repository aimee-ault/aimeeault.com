# Belgrade, Day 5: Kalemegdan, Belgrade Fortress

Yesterday, curious to see how Belgrade treats its riverfront for the Danube, I took several misguided steps out my front door due north. I didn't bother checking to see what was there. Unless I am making plans with other people, I usually do not scout out places in advance... I like the element of surprise. All the moments where I stumble upon mundane are worth it for those times where what I find is crazy and beautiful.  The thing about Belgrade is that there is no Google street maps available. I mean, the Google team has taken to giving a "street view" of the ocean before mapping out Belgrade. Not only that, but if you look at Belgrade in iOS Maps, the city is just... not there. A whole city, missing (well not really, it acknowledges that the city exists but it is merely 2 highways passing through it). ![screen_shot_2013_05_02_at_5_35_16_am_by_fartprincess-d63sc1g](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/screen_shot_2013_05_02_at_5_35_16_am_by_fartprincess-d63sc1g.png) A misguided impression of this part of the city, which was extremely industrial at a glance, led me to believe I would never get waterfront access and that all of these businesses had shipyards that took up the waterfront. I was really disappointed, but just decided to keep walking on. At some point there was a large pedestrian bridge leading over train tracks, but I thought, "Ain't nobody got time for crossing a pedestrian bridge" (I think largely in Internet memes), yet did decide I had time for climbing inside of a series of abandoned train cars. A few days ago, I asked a friend in Zagreb if they had ever heard of Gertrude Chandler Warner's Boxcar Children book series. I used to read these books when I was in the second and third grade. They were about 4 orphaned siblings who, in the first book and only the first book, lived in a boxcar until their rich grandfather took them in and from then on, their only worries were solving incredibly banal "mysteries" like "there is a house on our vacation island and we want to know who lived in it 50 years ago!" My friend in Zagreb had never heard of it so I asked a couple of friends I met here if they had heard of it... "nope!" My point is that climbing in these trains made me feel like one of the Boxcar Children. And by that, I mean, I curled up in the fetal position and cried myself to sleep thinking about my dead parents. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d63sccf](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d63sccf.jpg) Not sure what the story was here. I have never seen a decommissioned train in the wild before. Usually they're moved to a station somewhere where the owner either services it or, I dunno, sells the parts for scrap metal? ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d63sc8o](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d63sc8o.jpg) The wandering paid off eventually. I didn't intend to end up there, but I discovered Kalemegdan and then Belgrade Fortress. One of the surprising things about the buildings here is that from a distance, something will look abandoned and then somehow not be. From afar, I saw a 4-story building where an entire facade of it was removed and open to the outside with just random stone steps leading to nothing. From a block away, I thought, "There is no way anyone is still using that building." Get closer, and find a car parked out front and some guy standing in a yard. I guess the building was bombed during the war and the guy just didn't have the money to fix it... it's hard to assess people's economic status outside of your home country... I don't even try anymore. There's just too many things you can get wrong and on an individual level, it doesn't even matter anyway. Kalemegdan is busy. I don't know if it was because it was a holiday (I realized mid-day yesterday, after journaling, that it was May Day for most of the world), so an official public holiday. Seeing so many people together, I was paying a lot of attention to how everyone looked similar. A sea of dark hair. In general, I'm always trying to find what it is that makes people look unique to whatever region they live in. Men in the Balkans look different to me somehow from anywhere else I've been, but I'm not sure what it is exactly. It's something in the face. It's something in the nose and brow. I mean, yeah, not everyone looks the same, but it's a difference that stands out to me a lot when I see it. I also feel like women dress less conservatively in Belgrade. If that's true, it doesn't surprise me because it's a bigger city. ![7d7003b0b28611e294f522000a9f30b8_7_by_fartprincess-d63scdz](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/7d7003b0b28611e294f522000a9f30b8_7_by_fartprincess-d63scdz.jpg) ![66a94fbab28611e2a73522000a1faf50_7_by_fartprincess-d63scd7](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/66a94fbab28611e2a73522000a1faf50_7_by_fartprincess-d63scd7.jpg) ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d63sc59](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d63sc59.jpg) I also found out that something I said a few days ago apparently offended a bunch of people? I guess my sense of humor is lost internationally on some people. I was not at all serious when I made the remark about "Serbian freedom fighters" and cevapi. Why would I really think that Serbia has enforced military presence in defense of a barbecue and moreso, would I really be that blind to ignore the fact that the sign specifically states that the cevapi is from Bosnia? Jeez, come the fuck on and have some of this amazing cevapi that this guy with a gun selflessly defended for us :D I'll still ♥ all of you Croats even if you don't ♥ me. Deal with it. ![a23a22d4b28611e2945d22000a9f13ca_7_by_fartprincess-d63scd0](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/a23a22d4b28611e2945d22000a9f13ca_7_by_fartprincess-d63scd0.jpg) ![b9d26762b28611e28a1a22000aa81ffa_7_by_fartprincess-d63sccs](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/b9d26762b28611e28a1a22000aa81ffa_7_by_fartprincess-d63sccs.jpg) Belgrade Fortress also has some crazy artillery on display: ![8f2f46e2b28611e2bbc022000a9f1945_7_by_fartprincess-d63scdo](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/8f2f46e2b28611e2bbc022000a9f1945_7_by_fartprincess-d63scdo.jpg) We worry about kids playing with guns in the US, but look at what the Serb kids are playing with :P (hrrr hrrr, awkward gun control joke)
