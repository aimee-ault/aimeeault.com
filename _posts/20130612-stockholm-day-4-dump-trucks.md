# Stockholm, Day 4: Dump Trucks

This week is graduation week in Stockholm. The Swedes have a very unusual tradition for celebrating this: ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d68qkqj](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d68qkqj.jpg) "Woooooooo we finally fucking finished reading King Lear and we're leaving our high school like Cordelia is sent to exile wooooo!"  They rent dump trucks and ride around in them cheering and spraying beer everywhere. It doesn't seem like they are drinking any of the beer, just spraying it. There are dozens if not hundreds of them out roaming the streets of Stockholm right now. You can usually tell when one is nearby because you will hear a trademark thumping of loud bass. As you get closer, the smell of cheap beer overtakes the air as it hits the hot summer asphalt and before you know it, you're being serenaded with ABBA's "Dancing Queen." The ones that are not on this truck will walk around in white ship captain hats. A lot of the trucks are decorated, some advocating feminism and some advocating gay rights. Others just advocating getting loaded and partying, haha. To each their own! The funny thing is, the cheering just goes on and on. There's never an empty lull on these trucks. I watched two guys high five each other as I walked up the street and I wondered to myself, "How many times in the past hour have these two guys high fived?" People really, really celebrate high school graduation here! This article suggests that it's not uncommon for a family to spend 16,000 SEK on food, clothes, etc. Also, a girl in the article claims she spent 3,000 SEK on her graduation dress. That's a lot of money for a dress, potentially around the cost that some people pay for a wedding dress. That's very impractical! Why not buy something cheaper that will look almost the same for your stupid one-time event and save the money for something useful? Or would that be too smart for someone who is riding around town in a dump truck screaming. My host told me she is going to be surprising her granddaughter by showing up at her graduation, which is on the west coast of Sweden, 400km away. She pulled out this giant sign she had made which had a picture of her granddaughter as a baby and said "Grattis!" ("Congrats!") on it with the granddaughter's name at the top. At first I was thinking it was a weird sign to make but as I went outside earlier, I saw some other older women with the same exact type of sign for their own grandkids, complete with the name at the top and the "grattis!" in a word balloon overlaying a baby picture. It made me think about celebrating my own high school graduation. I remember my friends Martha, James, George, Frankie, and Ben went around but I don't remember much about it other than the fact that I was wearing this very skimpy dress, that we dumpster-dived and ended up at a diner. I definitely didn't drink. And I definitely didn't ride in a dumpster truck... although the dumpster-diving does connect, I suppose. The only way my family celebrated was with a cake. The cake included my graduation year on it, which is an odd thing to put on a piece of food, which is going to be gone in less than a day. I'm keeping this brief because I have plans for tonight and don't have much time to write. After a quite long break, I started working on finishing my book. A friend of mine in Croatia had asked me while I was there a lot of questions about my book and I had said it was hard to write it while traveling because I'm in a different timeline trying to write about something already passed with all sort of new things going on around me simultaneously, but I finally feel like I am in a good place where the two can sort of merge together. I also tend to write better when I'm feeling sad, so if I ever find myself there, I immediately run with it :) I find doing that is cathartic as well and helps me get some release. I had the best vegetarian lunch ever today at a place mostly only popular with locals called Herman's. I'm not a vegetarian, but I eat as healthy as I possibly can when given it as an option. It was hard to find good vegetarian food in East Europe. A lot of people there seem very offended at this accusation, but given the abundance of it in other parts of the world as a contrast, it really was. That's not to say Stockholm isn't without its unhealthy food--there are hot dog vendors everywhere and 7-11s on every block armed with an arsenal of junk food and candy. But being a more international city, it has more options. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d68qmrb](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d68qmrb.jpg) I accidentally messed up paying here and only paid for my drink, 40 SEK ($6 USD). Have I mentioned that Sweden is very expensive? I didn't feel too bad about this mistake knowing that. The drink was fantastic though. I don't know what all was in it but there is definitely mango at the top and it had mint flavoring. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d68qmrm](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d68qmrm.jpg) Herman's also has an amazing view of the waterfront. I'm leaving here on Monday and I don't have a place where I'm going next yet. I decided to alter my trip a bit because after London, I am returning to the United States... I've been leaving places on Mondays but I want to save my return trip for a weekend, so I'm going to visit somewhere else before I go to London (next Friday). I'm looking at Amsterdam right now but I'm not sure yet. After passing through Warsaw on my way here, I oddly have some desire to go to Poland. But I feel like if I want to go to a place like that, I really want to dedicate a lot of time there, so I'm sort of throwing that to the side for now. Because it is cheaper to buy a round trip ticket than a 1-way ticket transatlantic, I'm actually going to end up with a return flight to Europe, assuming I pay about $50 more, I can adjust the date of the return flight for whenever I feel like using it, presumably not any time soon. I don't feel any pressing need to immediately come back to Europe. If I don't use the ticket to Europe, it's no money lost :) If I do, I can have it my disposal for another year. Kind of cool. I'm not much a planner though--I'm very spontaneous if that's not obvious from reading this journal... when I left the US to come here, all I had officially planned out was Croatia, all my trips from there have just been on whim!
