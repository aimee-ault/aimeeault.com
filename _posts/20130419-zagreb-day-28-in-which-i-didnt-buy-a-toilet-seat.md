# Zagreb, Day 28: In Which I Didn't Buy A Toilet Seat

Today, I went to the post office. Or the Hrvatska Po≈°ta, rather. There seem to be only 2, one in Novi Zagreb and the other in Grad Zagreb. I figured I'd have better luck with the one in Grad Zagreb, so I hoofed it there. That's right, I idiomatically expedited myself there. My only other post office experience in Europe was in Barcelona. I obviously had a much easier time visiting the post office there given that I actually speak the language spoken there. Here, I simply had no idea what I was getting myself into. And when Luka asked me, "Are you going to the post office?" and I said yes, and he laughed... I figured it was probably going to be chaos.  The post office here wasn't awful at all, though. Like the one in Barcelona, it operates in a ticket system much like you would experience in an American DMV. The machine that gives you the ticket only has instructions in Croatian, however. You have to pick which category you want. I was able to understand enough of the Croatian on the screen... to know that I wanted "prioritetno pismo" (I know "pismo" is like "letter", I could only assume the word preceding was an adjective meaning "priority"). The post office seemed too empty to be needing this ticket system. I couldn't ever imagine it being more busy than it currently was. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d628tsp](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d628tsp.jpg) Within a couple of minutes, my ticket was up. "Govorite li engleski?" "A little bit." I knew enough Croatian to communicate what I wanted to send, but at the same time, I didn't want to risk having my stuff end up getting delivered to a goat farmer in Belarus, so I started to, for her benefit, get comically loud and slow with my English, not realizing that when she said "a little," she really actually meant, "I speak almost fluent English and am very ashamed that I don't know words like 'compunctious' and 'docile'." "Yes, I have TWO ITEMS. I WANT TO SEND THEM BY MAIL." She kind of backed away and laughed a little. "Okay! Both to the same address?" "No, no. Separate. One is a post card. The other is a letter. I don't have an envelope for the letter." The lady kept asking me if I wanted "normal" or "airmail." I said, "I don't know the difference." She said, "Airmail is 12 Kuna. Normal is 8 Kuna." I laughed, "So the only difference is that I pay you more?" Apparently, the humor was not lost because she laughed too, "No, it's faster." I said, "Fine, Airmail, I guess. For both." The price difference was so nominal... I mean... $2 to mail something internationally? That's so minor. The postcard she had me put inside of an envelope as well. I wasn't sure if that's how they handle all postcards here or if it was just because the postcard was made of balsa wood. Which I also thought was kind of dumb, but whatever. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d628tt2](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d628tt2.jpg) I think the woman sensed my enthusiasm for learning vocabulary, because she gave me a brief primer on postal/mail related words, like envelope. I knew nothing about this woman, we exchanged no small talk, but somehow she just read it in my face that I was inquisitive. I walked away from the exchange having successfully mailed two things and learned a few words :) ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d628tsh](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d628tsh.jpg) After leaving the post office, I walked out to the main square in the city. Zagreb has a lot of plazas. And I don't know any of them by name. This is the plaza everywhere knows though. With the bank. And the statue. And the trams. The market was down in the plaza. I hadn't bothered to really check it out because farmers' markets are farmers' markets. I lived 2 blocks from one of the biggest ones in the US for a while, so I know what it's like to walk around tents and see people selling soap made of goats milk. A friend here told me "oh they have all these unique flowers." I called bullshit on that, because I don't think there is a tremendous difference in vegetative and floral growth within the same longitude. I mean, yeah, there will be a bit of difference here and there, but nothing that is going to blow my mind. It's going to be similar to plants I've seen in North America in the same climate. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d6290qr](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d6290qr.jpg) But I wandered through the market anyway, because I had nothing to lose and well, that's how competitive of a debater I am, that I will scout out the source for reassurance that I am indeed right. Never debate with me if you hate debating because even if I am wrong, I will still continue to work any angle I can as long as it's fair to the debate and isn't weakly supported. It's more fun that way. The flowers on display were pretty much everything I see in north of the Mason-Dixon line in the US. A lot of Azaleas and Begonias and pots of overall shame for knowing the names of these flowers. I'm not really a "flower" person. I like seeing them in growing in the ground, but it ends there. I do like when I see a guy walking through town with some though because I feel like I just read a single page of a story. I like to think of all the possibilities and outcomes. Maybe they're "I'm sorry I fed your dog chocolate and killed it" flowers. Or maybe they're not. Either way, there's a story. Amongst the tents of flowers and jams was one tent that did catch my interest. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d628wlh](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d628wlh.jpg) Toilet seats? They're not even decorative. They're just plain white toilet seats. Why? I was tempted to stick around just to see what kind of Croat is showing up at the farmers' market to buy a new toilet seat. Or what kind of situation would dictate you needing to buy a new toilet seat at a temporarily established venue. Like what if you take it home and it doesn't fit on the toilet? It's like buying a magic monkey claw from a guy on a carpet and then he's gone the next day when you accidentally turn your wife into a rodent or something. I'm not even sure if that's a good deal on a toilet seat. There were meat markets by the farmers' market. I'm guessing these are always open, every day. It was like Pike Place Market in Seattle, sort of, except with less fish and more cuts of beef, an occasional pekarna situated in there as well. I started to think, "If you can have a pekarna and a ljekarna, could you have a mesokarna?" I'm going to just rightfully assume the answer is an uproarious "no." ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d628xes](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d628xes.jpg) I felt like I was doing espionage in the meat market, sneaking around taking awkward photos of meat with my phone.
