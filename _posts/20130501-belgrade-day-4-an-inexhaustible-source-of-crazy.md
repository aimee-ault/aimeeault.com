# Belgrade, Day 4: An Inexhaustible Source of Crazy

A couple of days ago when I went to UŠĆA, I noticed there were kids hanging around with a giant Easter rabbit. I thought, "That's... unusual. Wasn't Easter like, 3 weeks ago?" Fast-forward to this morning in which I head out to get some juice. The Mini MAXI down the street was closed, despite the sign on the door saying 0730 - 2330 среда (Wednesday).  I'm totally clumsy, like Mr. Bean levels of clumsiness, and sometimes I will go to open a door and fail. It's really embarrassing even writing this. In Zagreb, a woman in a store sat there laughing at me as it took me 3 attempts to open the door. So I got forceful with it, not realizing a woman with her 2 children was sitting in a car right next to me. I turned back around, defeated by the elusive door monster, and started to walk off but the woman in the car yelled to me and started to explain to me that the store wasn't open today. I asked, "Just this store or all stores?" She said, "mmm many stores do not work." I asked, "Is this all Wednesdays or...?" She got out of the car, walked to the store front, pointed at a piece of paper that was near the bottom of the door with special hours, which said "jedan dan" I thought that was a weird way of communicating "closed all day" -- that literally translates to "one day", except it's weird to say since the store is closed all day not open all day. It seems like it would have made more sense to say "nijedan dan"? Am I crazy? Either way, she started to explain to me how stuff is closed for Ускрс (Easter). This was such an extraordinary experience, having a stranger be so polite to me, to stop and explain the intricacies of her culture, aware that I was not from the area, offering to help me figure out where I should go to get what I need. I kind of stuttered on my words in leaving and could only choke out, "Thank you so much. You have been so unexpectedly helpful to me, like you wouldn't believe." And she just smiled. But this year, I will be experiencing Easter twice. Not that it's something I celebrate. But it now all makes sense. Orthodox churches will respect the Julian calendar while western churches respect the Gregorian calendar. The Julian calendar says Easter is this coming Sunday. This explains the kids with the Easter bunny. Even though I don't celebrate these holidays or even hold any respect for religion and spirituality, it still fascinates me to see the traditions that go with the holidays. I suppose it is a really cool time for me to be in this part of the world. Being here has taught me that I don't have to like something, respect it, or even give half a shit about it--I can just keep it to myself. My opinion does not matter to everyone in the world :) 

# Chaos

Yesterday was a clusterfuck for me. The Internet in my place went out. I'm renting through AirBnB and I have the entire place to myself but I have a "host" who lives in the same apartment building. She's on vacation in Spain though and seemed kind of indifferent when I called her with a lot of concern in my voice. Any other day, it wouldn't have been such a huge deal, but Tuesdays are when my dev team has our big demo call, I needed to be able to work, and I was afraid I'd miss the call, so to be told, "It goes out sometimes. It'll be back in a couple of hours," I thought, "Ugh, really? How is that an acceptable answer?" Fortunately Luka, Tomislav, and Miro were still in town for one more day and I was able to rush over to their apartment to do work and the Internet was back up by the time I got home. The amount of adrenaline and challenge is, as exciting as it is, exhausting. My brain feels waterlogged and like it just wants to sleep for a week, but I won't let it because my whole body would just feel restless inside. I refuse to call it culture shock because it's not really a cultural shift that is disorientating, as much as it is environmental change, sensory overload. I don't look at it negatively though... it's just... different. The temperature is suddenly very hot. And there are so many smells I'm picking up on. When I enter my building, the stairs spiral around the elevator. Every floor and half-floor has a new smell, a warm smell of paprika rising humidly through the air into the boiling pork on the next floor. Infusing echoing sounds of kids screaming, dogs barking, pipes rumbling, the building itself living and breathing as I climb up its sturdy ribs. When I took this picture, I had no idea how much it would encompass how I feel when I come back and lay down: ![what_i_really_want_to_say_i_can_t_define_by_fartprincess-d63hh2z](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/what_i_really_want_to_say_i_can_t_define_by_fartprincess-d63hh2z.jpg) All I can do is just lay back and take in the air and let it all go for a moment and be that clover that is converting atmospheric nitrogen into something that grows more prosperous fruits. Yesterday I got food from a pretty cool palačinkarnica. Palačinke means pancakes, but it's actually like crepes and they can be either salty/meat/cheese or sweet/fruit/nutella/cream. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d63opnz](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d63opnz.jpg) This was kokos, banane, ananas (coconut, banana, pineapple). This morning, when I actually did end up scavenging around for a small trgovina (shop) [I say that because sometimes they don't even have names on the storefront and are literally just labeled as such], I scouted up some of my neighborhood. There is a section of my neighborhood, which is the Bohemian district, where all these signs are pointing to different European cities. I didn't really stick around to figure it out but I didn't sense a huge multicultural vibe going on here. I think it was just kitschy. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d63oq7a](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d63oq7a.jpg) ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d63opl4](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d63opl4.jpg) There was a sign that claimed this was the true cultural center of Belgrade and that the city evolved around it. Sometimes, as an American, it's easy for me to see cobblestone and areas like this which have been preserved and fortified despite less visually pleasant surroundings and take them as being disingenuous. Because in the US, you will sometimes see areas that look like this when they are really just the result of gentrification rather than being actually historical preservation of culture. For example, Austin has a very strong musical background. It's where some of the greats started but the city has become gentrified with time as it grows more and more white and Latino and black culture is getting pushed out of the city... the city is losing its culture but you will see new establishments created that try to falsely create the image of culture where it doesn't exist. Granted, the US is a very young country and it's hard to make comparisons because of that. But all the same, this part of my neighborhood got me thinking about all of this, for sure. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d63opn5](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d63opn5.jpg)
