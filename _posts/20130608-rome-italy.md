# Rome, Italy

The past few days I was in Rome, Italy. I left prematurely for rather lamentable reasons, but not before exploring it in full color for your benefit. 

# "Internet!"

Last summer, I traveled to Les Sauvages, France for two weeks to join the rest of DeviantArt's development team for our annual offsite meet. We've had two of these total, both in very odd, obscure locations situated far from civilization. If there were a third, it would probably be in Antarctica. The one in Les Sauvages was hosted at a small day camp for children and with 40 grown adults gathered in a single activity room, unified wails of "INTERNET" could often be heard from the main building 30 feet away, usually heralded by one person that was devastatingly and aptly _pissed_ that he could not download the most recent database dump for his VM as others waited half an hour for an animated GIF from Glee on Tumblr to load or to ironically post a whiny groan about the slow Internet on Facebook. But we all bonded over this commiseration and now it is just a faint memory in our hearts, much like I imagine Auschwitz is to the Jews or the Rwandan genocide is to the Tutsis. Fast-forward one year exactly. I am standing in the train station at Fiumicino Airport lugging a suitcase, a duffel bag bearing the density of a dying sun, and a backpack strapped so tightly to my back that it felt like some irascible teenage hawk digging its talons into my shoulders. I am attempting to purchase a ticket for the Leonardo Express train to Termini Station, but the woman at the counter snaps back at me, demands even, that I spend 1 Euro more to purchase a ticket for the airport shuttle, arguing that it will deliver me straight to the door of the place I am staying. I'm not sure why I'm arguing this with her, because she has a valid point. For only a Euro more, I could free myself from the burden of dragging cheap plastic wheels over half a mile of loose cobblestone walkway. Though really, this would be a perfect ending to the luggage-wielding decathlon I'd participated in up until this point. I had already won the gold medal at deadlifting my 30-kilogram suitcase up 25 steps to access the train station, peculiarly located on the 2nd floor. Inside the shuttle van, the driver, a gruff portly man with about three days of facial stubble is smoking two cigarettes at once, exhaling swivels of dusty smoke while belting out an awkward karaoke performance of some cheap imitation of an American pop song, the only discernable words being things like "baby," "love you," and "suck me sideways." The three of us in the back are not sure if we speak a common language and so we are speaking to each other in quick, jaunty glances, our eyebrows all furrowing each time the driver goes sharply off-key. After getting out of the van at a street corner, uncertain of the building number, Giulia yells down to me from the top-floor terrace of the apartment and soon I am standing with her and Francesca in the living room, as Giulia delivers to me the horrifying news that there is a "situation with the Internet." I mouth out the words "oh no," but she flutters her hand at me and extends from her other hand a USB-powered mobile 4G modem. It felt like she were a cat giving me a dead rodent as a gift. I didn't want to take it, and yet she seemed so proud of it. Its signal light flickered weakly, a faint bleating, its heartbeat plaintively requesting, "Kill me, I should not exist." But I simply accepted it because I had a work call that I needed to join right then and I figured I could work things out later. The modem could not handle me talking on Skype calls or Mumble (yes, deviantART uses Mumble sometimes and no, we are not looking for 7 more to raid Icecrown Citadel). I could do development just fine, however, so I figured I could just grin and bear it. But the more disgruntled I grew trying to speak, the more I couldn't accept it. It was at this point that I learned that a survey from just a year ago revealed that only 54% of Italians use the Internet and that 25% of them actually think it is "useless." In 2005, Italy passed an anti-terrorism law that prohibits Italians from opening public WiFi hotspots without collecting valid personal information from the user. Because of this, almost every public network, even ones that are pay-to-use, require you to have an Italian phone number to join them. On the second day, I maxed out the bandwidth cap on the 4G plan and the ISP countered this by throttling the bandwidth severely. I was getting a 10,000ms ping on Google. Frustrated, I ended up renting a hotel room just so I could do work. The WiFi in the hotel was also slow (but let me get work done) and by the third day, I was wandering the streets of Rome with my Macbook open scouting open networks. I spent the entire afternoon of June 6th with my laptop open, seated on the ground of a sidewalk on Via Cavour in Rome, as stereotypical men passed me by talking to me with their hands. It must be weird to be a deaf Italian :) So it was the best of times and it was the blurst of times. At first, I was stressed a bit by this all. But ultimately, I am sort of glad that it all happened because it forced me to really deal with the situation and address why I find this kind of thing stressful. It was already happening, so being on edge wasn't going to help me in any way. So it gave me the opportunity to really keep my cool. I booked a flight out of Rome for Friday, figured out arrangements, and just made the best of a silly situation. Traveling has really started to make me see just how well I keep it together under pressure. Friends of mine have often told me that I seem to have a very unusual calm to me when it comes to disaster. I wish I could say I have always been that way, but I think it came with time. I think if I could sort of put some things past me, I'd actually be an amazing leader because I am very good at calming people down and getting others to work together to solve problems. Being in a place where the one thing I need the most is severely devalued and inaccessible, all I could do was be polite yet firm. I told Giulia, "I love it here, but I simply cannot work under these conditions and it's very important that I can, so I am going to be leaving early. I'm sorry." 

# The Real Rome

That aside, Rome was very cultural and beautiful. I am not sure why I picked Rome in particular. I was just interested in visiting Italy. I like Italian food, I speak the language conversationally, I totally have a thing for Italian dudes, I wanted to see sunlight again, and I just wanted to be somewhere different. The more I travel, the less "reason" I feel I need to go somewhere--just any urgency to expose myself to something new is enough. The Colosseum was the first thing I saw. I was staying near Via Cavour, which is about a 10-minute walk to Foro Romano, where all the old historical buildings are. This area is very touristy, unfortunately. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d68842w](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d68842w.jpg) ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d6883zp](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d6883zp.jpg) ![575949eecced11e2bf1822000aaa0492_7](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/575949eecced11e2bf1822000aaa0492_7.jpg) But it was gorgeous, all the same.
