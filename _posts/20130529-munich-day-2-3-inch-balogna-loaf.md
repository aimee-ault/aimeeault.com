# Munich, Day 2: 3-Inch Balogna Loaf

Today I realized that documenting my stay in Germany will probably be a bit more difficult than it was in Zagreb and Beograd. Culturally and linguistically, it's harder for me to make observations because I'm fairly in tune with German culture in some respect, but I'll give it an earnest effort. I'm only in Munich for a week!  I'm about half a kilometer from Marienplatz, Munich's main square. The most notable thing about this square is that there is this glockenspiel that gets played twice a day and people (tourists) go apeshit over it. In the square there is a golden statue of the Virgin Mary atop a column that was installed in celebration of the end of the Thirty Years War. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d670o92](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d670o92.jpg) ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d670o7t](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d670o7t.jpg) ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d670o5s](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d670o5s.jpg) ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d670nxg](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d670nxg.jpg) ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d670nzg](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d670nzg.jpg) If I seem totally disinterested in this, I'm not but I feel wrong giving focus to this kind of stuff that you can see written about in all sorts of lame tourist guides like Fodor's. I like history, don't get me wrong, but I often get bummed when I see people flock to things just because a tourist book tells them it's important. It reminds me of a social experiment that was conducted a few years ago in New York. A famous violinist, Joshua Bell, whose concerts are routinely sold out, played for free incognito in a New York subway station. He barely received any attention when he played in the subway, yet his show that same night was sold out. Because people often don't really know how to appreciate things for what they really are. They pay attention to things because they feel they are supposed to. It's fine to say "I don't know art but I know what I like." Because at least that's more honest an answer than what some other people do and think. A good example of this, I stumbled upon yesterday: ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d670o8b](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d670o8b.jpg) There are four lions outside of Alte Residenz. People stop and rub them for good luck. There is no story behind it. People just do it though because tourist guides tell them they should. I'd love to know the origin of it but I doubt it's really that complicated--a lot of places have these kinds of superstitions of rubbing or touching something for luck. One of my flatmates here was telling me a common story about Niels Bohr having a horseshoe above his door. Someone commented, "I thought you didn't believe in superstition." And Niels responds, "They say it works even if you don’t believe." ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d670o8n](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d670o8n.jpg) I like the statues regardless of whether people want to wipe their boogers on them. I went into the Jewish museum here. I learned a lot about Jewish tradition. I unfortunately did not get to really take many photos because it was forbidden. I guess it would be in bad form for me to say that the museum security were real Nazis about it, right? I learned about the shofar horn and Purim. Purim being a religious holiday celebrating the deliverance of the Jewish people from the Persian Empire after Harman threatened to execute them. So on the holiday, they'll read from the Magileh and every time the name Harman comes up, they'll pull out these graggers (noisemakers) to deafen the sound of the name. So it's like a He Who Must Not Be Named kind of deal on that holiday. There was also a really cool exhibit on the taboos of Jewish persecution in concentration camps focusing around sexually exploited women. It was really depressing, with quotes and first-hand accounts from women, one where some young girl was encouraged to get pregnant by an officer, despite it being such a traumatizing thing, just to ensure that they live on. I tried to remember some of the words, hoping to find it online because some of it read quite stunningly, but I couldn't find anything. The most interesting thing I learned, however, was about comics during the McCarthy Era. There was this child psychologist named Frederic Wertham who claimed in his book "Seduction of the Innocent" that comics were suggestive and that they would make your kids gay or promiscuous or drug-users. So a bunch of people made these awesome comics like "Freddy Wertham Goes to Hell," a Lovecraftian number satirizing the guy's whole set of principles on comic book art. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d670o6g](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d670o6g.jpg) ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d670o67](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d670o67.jpg) Ich aß Schnitzel im Brot für das Mittagessen. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d670o76](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d670o76.jpg) mit Sauce. And trolled a duck into thinking I had food for it because I'm an asshole :) ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d670o6m](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d670o6m.jpg) Met Supermen: ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d670o7c](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d670o7c.jpg) And had an awkward moment where I honestly tried to say the word "zweinzig" to a woman because I had a weird recall memory lapse where I forgot it was "zwanzig." Um. Yeah. I also learned that Bavarian meatloaf is not like American meatloaf but rather like eating a 3" thick piece of balogna:
