# Novi Sad/Belgrade, Day 1: Meat Fiesta

Yesterday morning, I jammed all of my clothes back into their luggage, zipped up my duffel bag, and threw my stuff into the back of Luka's car. Picking up two of his friends, Tomislav and Miro, we headed to Belgrade, Serbia. Them, for PHPDay. Me, for the next leg of my journey. I'm going to be writing a recap and proper "goodbye!" to Croatia in the next few days, as soon as I sort through the 1,921 photos I have.  I want to make a quick note that over the past month, I've noticed that almost all men I met have the same names. There's maybe 5 or 6 names total I hear. Tomislav, Ivan, Hrvoje. I'm speaking hyperbolically of course. I'm sure it's all in the same fashion as going to the US and meeting a ton of guys named James, Mike, Chris, Dave, and Ben. When we got to the border, a discussion came up about how weird I am about the notion of having my passport stamp closed. Everyone agreed that Croatia does not give exit stamps. One of the guys was trying to say Slovenia doesn't either, but I showed him where it was stamped in my booklet. Curious, I ended up looking this up and finding out that there are a small handful of countries who do not issue exit stamps, only entry... such as the US and Croatia. It's not a huge amount of countries though--so me noticing this or making note of it really isn't that uncalled for. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d63b22o](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d63b22o.jpg) Once across the border, we stopped at a gas station and I took out some money with the ATM. Standing at the ATM, I realized I didn't know the conversion rate. They were saying it was 1 dollar = 100 Dinar, but the RSD is in such constant flux that today, 1 USD = 87 RSD. I took out 1000 Dinar and then Luka laughed at me for that, explaining that that was about $10 USD. So I made a second transaction and got 20,000 RSD. I felt weird holding "that much money", even though in reality that's about $235. I heard some interesting stories about the Dinar back when Serbia's economy was very, very unstable either during the war or post-war. Where the RSD was so worthless that millions of Dinar would get you a pack of gum and people's entire salaries could get them a bottle of beer. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d63b21u](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d63b21u.jpg) The highway to Serbia, all the guys in the car thought it was boring. I thought it was kind of charming though. There are no billboards along the highway. It's just you, the car, other cars, and kilometers and kilometers of farmland. The farms seem to have very rich, fertile soil that productively grows healthy, deeply green grass which, for the entire trip, you could smell it being freshly cut. In the midst of all of this were enormous, endless seas of chartreuse clover. I didn't know why anyone would specifically grow clover. It seemed so well plotted out that I knew it wasn't inadvertent organic growth. And so I learned on my own (in case anyone was curious) that farmers will rotate out crops with clover to give the soil a "rest," to preserve its nutrients. The advantage of intercropping with clover is that the clover is great for nitrogen fixing, so it will absorb nitrogen from the atmosphere and convert that into a "fixed" nitrogen inorganic compound. So if a soil lacks the symbiotic bacteria necessary to do all of this, you can usually supplement it with one of these cereal plants and it'll do the job in lieu. Okay, taking my scholar's cap off and returning to shit that has nothing to do with dirt :) And all of this after I just assumed that the clover growth had something to do with production of honey wine. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d63b217](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d63b217.jpg) We got off the highway and on to a small road that I swear was a dirt road at some point, which led to Novi Sad. I only got freaked out a few times by Luka's driving here, to the point that it didn't even really faze me when he decided to overtake 4 cars in a row heading towards a bend in the road. He has the driving style of a cab driver in a second-world country (I've had people harp on me for using that term, since first-third modifiers were constructions of the Cold War and are antiquated--know that when I say 'second-world', I mean previous third world but economically on the rise enough to be functional). But yeah. The driving didn't really scare me. I'm not sure what has changed my attitude towards cars more, the fact that I haven't owned one in over 2 years or the fact that my primary mode of transportation is bicycle and it makes me realize how vulnerable your life is when you add in the element of speed. When he was in Texas for SXSW, Luka had taken over a rental car for a friend, Joe Peacock, and it was this insane Dodge Challenger. I'd been in cars with other friends quite a bit that month, yet the rapid acceleration made me nauseous when it was done in places I felt were either high-traffic or had a low speed limit (like flooring it when the speed limit is 35MPH) and he said, "Oh you'll hate Croatian drivers then." But here in East Europe, I don't really notice anything awful about the driving, no worse than when I lived in the southern US. A lot of misguided, thoughtless actions but nothing harrowing that makes me feel like my life is about to come to an abrupt end. Signs started cropping up in Cyrillic. I think I'm really going to have a fun time with the language here, trying to make sense of Cyrillic. Some of the letters are not direct translations. For example, in Cyrllic, the 'C' replaces the 'S' in Latin script, the 'P' replaces 'R', 'Y' for 'U', and then several glyphs that I don't know how to type but are pretty neat. My favorite letter in the Cyrillic alphabet so far is the Ð—, which looks like the number 3. Novi Sad was like a thirsty mirage appearing after so much dirt road and nullity. It didn't strike me as a huge city (and it's not) and I couldn't decide if my initial impression of it was negative or positive. It was very hot and sunny outside and there were bridges crossing the Danube River into the city that gave it that sort of "approaching Mecca" vibe you get with cities that are situated in the middle of nowhere, as Novi Sad is. We drove through the main part of the city and then back out to a restaurant called Salas 137 at Cenej. It was an old farm turned into a restaurant. There we met Vranac, Jelena, and Robert. I think my reaction to the location may have been overdone because when Robert got out of the car and saw me, he laughed and said, "WELCOME TO SERBIA." The Serbs I have met so far are very, very nice people. Very outgoing and talkative. In the same way that Croats tend to slip back into their own language, the Serbs do the same. There is always one person in the mix in every one of these situations I end up in where one person in the group will suddenly remind everyone, "Hey speak in English, please." But it never sticks :) People will interact with me one on one in English, but I am sort of left out of the general group conversation... which is nice. It gives me a chance to absorb the language some without the pressure to participate. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d63b20k](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d63b20k.jpg)
