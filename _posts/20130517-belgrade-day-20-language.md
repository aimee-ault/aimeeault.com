# Belgrade, Day 20: Language!

Last night I hung out with someone who reads my journal. As in, that was our only existing established connection (for reference, this is the person who wrote to me and called me furzprincino--how could I not meet someone who calls me my own username in Esperanto?). It was kind of unusual, or as he remarked, "It feels like I'm spending time with Oprah." It was nice, in general, to hang out with someone who is also a world traveler and language-lover and get a more in-depth, albeit still somewhat broad (but suitable for me), explanation of the intricacies of Serbo-Croatian and how each language here differs from the other.  I know little differences as I come across them, but not usually the meaning behind those differences. For example, I know in Croatian, you always say "što" ("what") and the same word in Serbian, though it changes if you are using it in interrogative context to "šta" (interrogative here doesn't even imply that a question is being asked, as long as it has interrogative meaning behind it) **Interrogative in Serbian:** "Ja pitam šta je on rekao." ("I question what he said") **Declarative in Serbian:** (from one of my favorite movies, I took a slight liberty in my translation) "Ja ću jedem što ona jede." ("I'll have what she's having." [literally translates to "I'll eat what she eats"]) I doubled-checked the latter with Google Translate, which I try not to use if I can possibly avoid it, and it seems to disagree with me on my use of što in the second sentence. I can maybe understand why it would suggest šta because if you knew what someone else was eating, you'd just... say what they were eating, or assuming you were sitting at the same table, you might just say, "I'll have the same thing" rather than be all awkwardly verbose about it. In the example cited, from When Harry Met Sally, it is an older woman sitting at another table, saying it after hearing the eponymous character Sally fake an orgasm in a diner. The woman has no idea what Sally is eating. She just knows she wants it! I don't sense any interrogative meaning in it though--she obviously does not care what Sally is eating. She's more interested in the idea that her food is going to cause her to have waves of orgasmic pleasure. Also, this is a gross example. No one has ever thought about this line in that movie as much as I have right now. As I imagined, but didn't really know the hows or whys, the split in language is commonly politically devised. I had a friend in Croatia mention something to me about this before, in which he had given me an example that the 'Ž' is a totally unnecessary letter because there are no words that need that disambiguation--I thought he had said the letter was introduced for political reasons to separate from Hungary, but the Hungarian alphabet has a 'Zs' character which is really the same thing as Ž, so phonetically it's the same. I'm also probably misremembering this because Hungarian is not even part of the same language group as Serbo-Croatian-Bosnian. Hungarian is part of the Uralic or Ugric family. Serbo-Croatian is part of the Slavic family. I still think due to geographic proximity, you see with history all of these languages make at least some sizable impact on each other. Ethnic groups do not live in total isolation. Wars have been waged. Romances have been had. Friendships have been made. It's life. Someone sent me a [video on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHYR7vLVUmY) recently about Hungarian language and why it's the most beautiful language. I've spent virtually no time looking at Hungarian, but it's a sweet language from what I saw. One of the people being interviewed said that their first word they learned was "elmosolyodik" which means "to lapse into a smile." I call bullshit on that (not too much though because, believe it or not, the first Korean word I was ever exposed to was "pongu", which means, get ready, "fart"). But that's still a beautiful word. Hungarian is definitely a very far removed language. I'm realizing after spending time here that it's really impossible to understand the linguistics without getting an understanding of the history of each country. Imagine being in Croatia and Serbia and Bosnia and trying to get an understanding of the languages without an understanding that there was a war. Anyway, it was interesting! I also saw some parts of Kalemegdan I've never seen before and got to have a drink over at Kasina somewhat near Trg Republike, which was nice if not totally loud and smokey. I'm not sure what it is, but here I feel like, speaking even slightly less English than I normally would, I am losing a very small grasp on my own idiosyncratic use of the English language. I was talking on Skype the other day to a friend back in the US and had a moment where I forgot a word in the English language. This guy was talking about an age where he remembered thinking without language. I don't ever remember thinking free of words, but it reminded me of this short story I wanted to write when I was younger about a guy who had no language and, due to some sort of brain injury, was incapable of learning language. Over the years, my understanding of language has been redefined and I see the plausibility of that being greatly diminished by things like sign language, which has non-manual markers that are typically instinctive. When you shrug your shoulders, you are speaking in a language. When you smile, you are speaking in a language. It's just not verbal. **Unrelated:** ![2013_05_16_13_10_03_2_by_fartprincess-d65g7zk](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/2013_05_16_13_10_03_2_by_fartprincess-d65g7zk.jpg) After taking this, I kept thinking, "What the fuck happened on June 11th?" Oh right, different date format. Presidential election on November 6th. I was kind of surprised by this because I thought President Obama was generally well-received internationally, at least well enough that I wouldn't expect anyone to liken his winning second-term election to the Holocaust or to describe him as cannibalistic. :-? I'm also realizing I had 2 Day 18s in Belgrade. To be honest, it kind of felt like a continuation of the same day because I spent so much time working yesterday that I didn't really get much sleep :| ALSO, a friend of mine back in Texas, knowing I'm into language, semiotics, and graffiti linked me to this interesting video about [that S shape we all drew in school](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSH10f-7Vds). This guy thinks its origins link back to graffiti. I've never really thought too much about it. I think I drew it when I was in the 6th grade. So, 1996. I've seen it a couple of times on buildings here in Serbia. It kind of surprised me to find it was internationally known! I'll end this with a quote from one of my favorite authors, Albert Camus in Retour à Tipaza. Sometimes being an existentialist is awesome because it makes you realize there is no greater challenge than simply being alive. 

> There is no such thing as fate. It's all inside of you. "In the midst of hate, I found there was, within me, an invincible love. In the midst of tears, I found there was, within me, an invincible smile. In the midst of chaos, I found there was, within me, an invincible calm. I realized, through it all, that in the midst of winter, I found there was, within me, an invincible summer. And that makes me happy. For it says that no matter how hard the world pushes against me, within me, there’s something stronger – something better, pushing right back."
