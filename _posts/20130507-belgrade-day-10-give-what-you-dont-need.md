# Belgrade, Day 10: Give What You Don't Need

May is **Math Awareness Month** in Serbia. It's so important, in fact, there is an event in the most popular part of the city dedicated to it, M3. Just math. Nothing else. I wasn't looking for it, but I stumbled into it. It was very busy and very hands-on and fun! Not just for kids, for everyone.  ![c5a484eab63111e2b98822000aaa0338_7_by_fartprincess-d64eu08](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/c5a484eab63111e2b98822000aaa0338_7_by_fartprincess-d64eu08.jpg) A Caesar cipher wheel! I thought it was cool to see it with the Cyrillic alphabet :) ![fefee622b63611e2b2fd22000a9e0875_7_by_fartprincess-d64etzl](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/fefee622b63611e2b2fd22000a9e0875_7_by_fartprincess-d64etzl.jpg) I voted for Euler's Identity because I mean, that's the representation of mathematical beauty. Everyone knows that. Wondering who's voting for Schrödinger's equation and why, haha. As I voted, a mom and her young son were deciding on which to vote for. The mom asked the son which he would pick and he adamantly said, "I want to pick the one that is most popular!" I laughed. Still thought it was cool that a mom was taking her young son to this and getting him excited for math :) I guess the Pythagorean Theorem is an okay formula? It's a very low-resource way of trying to solve a shortest path problem. **Also, how fucked would it be if math in Serbia were done in Cyrillic? Like:** Solve for х: 3З = х Haha (the З is a z in latin script, the х is actually h) Curious to learn more, I started reading up on old Cyrillic numerals and it's kind of got a fascinating language history, but I'm more interested in the evolution of the language itself. Mostly, I like finding patterns and balance in language, that's beauty--symmetry and repetition. The numeric values are represented in ligatural glyphs combining the numeral characters themselves with a titlo placed over the numeral. It's an ionic number system, which is not something you see in modern language. And ionic systems, albeit intellectually gratifying to modern language nerds, have silly amounts of verbosity to them that would make doing complex math or science painful. So, as one of my friends said when I joked about doing math in Cyrillic: "That would just be cruel." ![ab43a374b63611e2a77722000a1fbc49_7_by_fartprincess-d64eu0j](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/ab43a374b63611e2a77722000a1fbc49_7_by_fartprincess-d64eu0j.jpg) ♥ math. It's universal. Interesting discovery: The font Segoe UI contains the Early Cyrillic alphabet. Why? I don't know, but it's cool that it does! 

# The Wall of Give and Take

At Hilandarska 26, near my neighborhood, there is a section that is part of a normal apartment building that always has junk left on it. The first time I saw it, the wall was covered with small old toys. I thought it was maybe a memorial to a juvenile casualty of war, but there was nothing really in memoriam to be found and there weren't any clues as to what this wall was exactly. ![d518fec6b63e11e28dc022000a1f8c21_7__1__by_fartprincess-d64eu01](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/d518fec6b63e11e28dc022000a1f8c21_7__1__by_fartprincess-d64eu01.jpg) I pass it nearly every day though, and the contents on the wall change. Some days there are less things on it and some days it feels like it is swelling with items. Yesterday was one of the days where there was little to be found. 2 old television remotes. A dirty Mickey Mouse desk organizer with a used train ticket inside, a soiled, naked doll, and a decorate window display of two children kissing. But with its emptiness, I was finally able to notice the clue, the words scribbled in fading black paint. This is what bugs me when anyone makes fun of me for paying attention to graffiti. Sometimes huge cultural markings are to be found, such as this location: 

### daj šta ti ne treba

**Give what you do not need.** ![7e04a368b63611e2877122000a1fbc4f_7_by_fartprincess-d64eu0r](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/7e04a368b63611e2877122000a1fbc4f_7_by_fartprincess-d64eu0r.jpg) This is all some people have! And more importantly, what seems like decrepit trash to me... is what some people think they need! Yesterday, I had found a blog written by an educator at a local international school in Belgrade while looking for information on "gypsymobiles" He had some photos from one entry of the houses the romi people live in and showed some stuff that really heavily pointed at the fact that they are very much hoarders. Not in that they do have much, but in that everything they have, they hold on to. It's the mentality, not the inventory. For me, it's hard to relate to it. I am highly ascetic. I may enjoy having an item for as long as it serves me, but once I have gotten what I need from it, it's time to pass it on to someone else. Letting go of material things is great because it allows you to start seeing yourself for who you really are rather than what you own. It also makes you better at "McGuyver"-ing your way in survival scenarios :) A friend asked me if I placed anything on the wall. I said no, he asked why not. I guess because I follow the Star Trek prime directive: "There can be no interference with the internal development of alien civilizations." I wouldn't respect myself if I somehow tainted the organic growth of something. It's not that it is not inviting to an international community. It's that it is inclusive to a certain socioeconomic disposition that I do not fall within. So even anonymously, I would feel wrong leaving something, like I were doing it for show. And that's not me. It's a funny distinction to make because in Zagreb, I went geocaching. Geocaching is where people hide these little capsules. Sometimes they are in hiking locations and sometimes around a city. They're intentional hard to find and you usually have to figure out some clues. It's fun. The caches have a log so you can leave your name and date and then you are invited to leave something inside of the cache and take something if there is room for it. So I participated in that because it's inviting to me and it gives me the opportunity to share my culture with others. I ended up leaving an American dime along with a URL for this blog :) Sometimes I feel weird when I stop and think about what I am doing. Every time I take a little bit of another places's culture, that becomes more adapted into who I am. In some ways, I understand the plight of the gypsies/romi/roma. They are not literally homeless. They are simply not integrated into any modern society. They are wanderers. And so am I. But I don't look at it negatively. Because home is where I am. Home is where I survive. Home is me. And every time I learn something new, every time I am touched by something, it becomes part of me and I take it with me. Neil deGrasse Tyson said, and this is one of my favorite things ever, "We are a part of this universe. We are in this universe. But perhaps more important than both of these facts, is that the universe is in us."
