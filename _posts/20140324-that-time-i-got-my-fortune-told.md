# That Time I Got My Fortune Told

I'm not spiritual. I'm not religious. I don't believe in arcane powers. I don't believe that anyone, short of a time traveler, knows what the future holds with any degree of certainty. But every time I pass by a psychic's booth on a dark, steamy street in a big city, I wonder what they would say to me. Perhaps it's some element of self-importance or deep introspection--maybe I will be the one that defeats it and will be "unreadable," a brooding passenger in the sands of time, confounding and perplexing the most clairvoyant of the world. I'm not skeptical of psychics entirely, though, just their supernatural powers. Because like others, their profession operates entirely on slight of hand. Their job is to read--it's just not cards they're reading. They're reading _you_.  While walking the V&A Waterfront in Cape Town, I passed inside the Wellness bazaar. This is a horrible assortment of: 

  * Voodoo trinkets
  * Chakra readings
  * Reflexology
  * Massages
And of course, 
  * Psychic readings
For $20, I would get a 30-minute tarot card reading. As someone who is normally grossly fidgety with money, this seemed inordinately expensive. But I decided to go along anyway because I thought it would be a funny thing to write about. 

## How did I feel about psychics before visiting one?

Complete and utter bullshit. A waste of money. I knew very little about what they did, but I knew that no matter what that entailed, it would be built on a foundation of lies. 

## What happens?

The psychic booth at the bazaar had the psychic equivalent of a pimp or a madam, who stood at a counter and took money and did very little else. She also offered a spray that would "realign" my "chakra." The woman offering this service managed to say this with a straight face and somehow, against all odds, I kept a straight face as the weirdness of the words softly deafened what was left of my visible amusement. The psychic I met was a woman named Anne. She was old and soft-spoken, matronly without any of the endearing characteristics I associate with a grandma. I took a seat across the small black table from her and intentionally postured myself in a fashion that I thought would make me difficult to read. I didn't want to seem nervous or uptight nor did I want to seem overly relaxed or cocky. She handed me a deck of old, beaten cards and asked me to shuffle them. I learned after-the-fact that they make you do this to make you feel more like the future drawn involves you. As she instructed me to do this, she asked if I had a particular topic I wanted to focus on. I said no, but I could easily see someone coming to a psychic in a time of turmoil, like after a death in the family, a period of bad health, an ending relationship, or a job loss. I have nothing supremely wacky and unresolved going on in my life at the moment, even though I'm in a period of job transition between DeviantArt and my soon-to-be new job with Treehouse in a couple of weeks... and I'm doing a lot of new stuff. I asked if it mattered how well they cards were shuffled and she said, "Just whatever feels right for you." I'm not particularly good at shuffling cards so I just sort of weaved them around. I found my hands fumbling trying to do this quickly. I wondered if she'd pick up on it as a nervous tic. Or if I had magnificently shuffled them like an expert, if she would take that as a grandiose sign of confidence. I forced myself to stop evaluating these things because I realized she would probably notice I was distracted by it. After I shuffled the cards, she spread them out on the table face-down and asked me to pick 10. I always find, in these circumstances, that I will pick the very first and last, and then pick randomly within. An odd "divide and conquer" search algorithm, I suppose. The 10 cards were then revealed in some meaningless configuration, and she pointed to the "death" card to inform me that I was going through a very large transformation in my life at the moment. Although that is certainly true, I didn't think much of it because... whose life _isn't_ going through transformation? I didn't say anything and let her continue to reveal to me that the events in my life trace back to a single isolated event. Again, true, but well, isn't that how it always is? It reminded me of the fortune-teller scene from the movie _Before Sunrise_: 

> **Jesse**: I mean, just once, I'd love to see, some little old lady save up all her money, to go to the fortune teller, and she'd get there, all excited about hearing her future, and the woman would say, "Um-humm. Tomorrow, and all your remaining days will be exactly like today. A tedious collection of hours. And you will have no new passions, and no new thoughts and no new travels, and when you die, you'll be completely forgotten.

I could feel her struggling to really come up with a story for me initially. Her job is to read my face and minute gestures, but I was being dodgy and evasive, silent and not asking any questions that she could feed from. She spoke in vague generalities, letting me know that this transformative period in my life is one I have brought for myself because I am looking to create something new while also trying to figure out who I am, and that I have all the things I need already to be a success--that it is a matter of bringing those things together. 

## More shuffling

She asks me again to shuffle the cards and start anew. I ask if there is a reason for this. She informs that we'll continue to do this to get more information from the cards--that some things will not be immediately revealed. One card in particular repeatedly came up every draw. The first time it came up, she asked if I had health problems. I paused for a moment to think, but then told her no. The only "health problem" I've had was several months ago, in which I had to have a periodontal cleaning at the dentist... hardly a pressing issue in the grand picture.  I caught myself giving some pretty strong skepticism to this, rather than my gentle nodding. The psychic reacted by telling me, "Maybe it is just personal stress then... you carry stress much more than others. When you experience anxiety, it takes its toll on you." This is actually fairly true about me. And pretty much anyone who has ever spent time with me knows this... it's certainly something you could read on a person based on their posture and facial expressions. The card kept coming up in every draw. She would mention it every time, trying to dig deeper, convinced I had some sort of health issue I maybe wasn't aware of yet. I couldn't think of anything. I'm in totally reasonable health, as far as I know. If the next time I get an annual check-up it's revealed I have cancer, I'm sure I'll think back to Anne the Psychic, and say, "Well that certainly was an odd coincidence." 

## My "soulmate"

Anne was convinced that I have a "soulmate," but told me that a number of factors were preventing me from coming to terms with this, namely that I am "unable to commit to places, people, and life events." I think this is one of the most fascinatingly specific things she told me, mostly because it came out of nowhere and isn't something you would ordinarily say to a woman--most women are not commitment phobic and it is a weird thing to be able to read on someone.
