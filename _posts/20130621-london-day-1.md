# London, Day 1

Today, I am in London, England. It hit me very hard today how chaotic my life has been. As I passed through border patrol leaving Amsterdam, the guy was having trouble finding my entrance stamp in my passport (for some reason, border patrol can't seem to understand that my passport has 20 other empty pages and so I have about 20 passport stamps covering 4 pages). He asked which country I entered Amsterdam through. I said, "Italy... no wait, that's not right. Sweden?" I couldn't remember. I even had a disconcerting moment where I forgot where I was.  ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d69ztre](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d69ztre.jpg) I had a fun experience with the border patrol here. The man had decided I didn't look anything remotely close to my actual age, so he started to grill me with all sorts of questions about who I am, what I do, where I've been. ("When did you visit France?") ("Which cities in Germany have you been in?"). If someone issued me a real, thorough examination about the events of my entire life, I'd like to believe I would pass it, but this mini-examination gave me a bit of doubt. I've been getting a lot of the inaccurate assessments about my age. At 28, I guess it's more flattering than it is annoying, but it's annoying that everyone has to conclude with the cliche, "You'll appreciate it when you're 40 and you look 30." It'd be nicer to hear someone reassure me that my mental dexterity will be that of a 30-year-old when I'm 40. But this is the last bit of my journey through Europe. I'm returning back to the United States in a mere week. Although I have come to learn that I don't really need "stability" to survive, I do think that being back will help give me a gentle mental reset. (Interestingly it also concludes my machine learning course ending as well as my NLP course). This weekend, DomÂ is coming down(?) to London, so I'm excited about that. I'm also realizing what a learning experience this whole trip has been. I have picked up more about language than ever. I never thought I'd be able to read Cyrillic (to some extent) or actually get a fairly okay beginner's grasp at Croatian/Serbian and even oddly enough, a tiny bit of Russian. I'm happy for what I have learned. I'm happy that being in an international setting has encouraged me to get moving on things that I needed to do, projects I really cared about working on, and studying and speaking languages that I already knew (Spanish) or once knew (Esperanto). Not to mention, it really has helped me get a better sense of who I am as an individual. I still see some of my own flaws that I want to improve, but a lot of things I thought could be good about me, I really have learned to let come out. And so I feel a sense of achievement with that. Anyway, to conclude my thoughts on that, here's a cool video on the Contributions of Female Explorers :):
