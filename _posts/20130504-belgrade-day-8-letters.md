# Belgrade, Day 8: Letters

Yesterday, I found what I've always been looking for. Sitting at my dining room table, doing some work to avoid the blazing inferno outside, my eyes scanned over my bedroom, assessing everything within it. Being an AirBnB rental, the apartment is obviously furnished by someone else, not me. And above my bed is a couple of bookshelves with random things scattered, one being an englesko-srpski reƒçnik.  I hadn't paid it much attention overall because, after watching Erin McKean's talk on "[The Joy of Lexicography](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4VzuWmN8zY)," and even before but with much less of a grasp on the "why", I've sort of viewed physical dictionaries as something that impose severe limitations on the growth of language. A physical dictionary simply cannot keep up with the timely evolution of language that happens around us on a day-by-day basis. We are constantly adding new words to our personal lexicons and to our languages' lexicons and dropping them in a heartbeat. Or words become archaic albeit still relevant and we make mental footnote of that. But physical dictionaries undergo constant debate about what is and isn't appropriate to add--like whether words like "man cave" or "sexting" belong in the dictionary (they do now). But as much as I disagree with the marshaling of language, I love the debate all the same and I will still pick up dictionaries to see just what some committee decided were the "relevant" words to the language that edition. I, on the large, will disagree with Erin McKean's idea that a computational approach of compiling language is still backed on Victorian design though with a touch of modernity--that's clearly something said by someone who does not understand the endless possibilities of technology (to give her the benefit of the doubt, her speech was from 2007 which is before NLP and machine learning became everyday topics amongst developers and engineers). But using computers, we can extract potent linguistic information from large volumes of data ... in a way that no human could ever undertake... it's not something to scoff. Even simple Markov model POS-tagging tells us so much about words and how they are used. I will be greatly disappointed with myself if at some point in my life, I do not make some sort of notable contribution to the world that ties language evolution to modern technology. But anyway, as Erin McKean says, "Love makes things real. If you love a word, use it. That makes it real." Boners. For real though, language and words are built as we find need for it. It's a creative process. Or, as she also says, "Paper is the enemy of words." And it really is. Language is infinite--don't constrict it to some finite physical material. So I opened the dictionary to get a window into the linguistic culture of Serbia 20 years ago, only to have a note fall out. And this is what I was looking for. Everywhere I go, I am constantly on the hunt for some sort of personalized approach to a language. This started sometime in 2009 when I, while walking down the street in South Carolina, found an unbelievable letter written from a man to a woman, pouring his heart out in some of the most inscrutably colloquial English. I've always wanted to find something like this in Spanish, which is my favorite language, but never have. But yesterday I found: ![2013_05_04_16_39_09_by_fartprincess-d645c0j](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/2013_05_04_16_39_09_by_fartprincess-d645c0j.jpg) I can read bits and pieces of it. I could just as easily type all of this into Google Translate, but I like the concept of its as a linguistic puzzle to be solved. This is a piece of paper that has been passed back and forth between two girls, probably in school. Something on the back of the paper possibly sets the context that it was written in 2005 and puts the age of the writer at 19. One of my friends commented, without telling me what it says, that the people writing it might be gypsies because they have horrible grammar. It may seem like I want to find things like this because of their highly emotional nature, but it's not my reason. I like to see pure documented examples of how language is used in both the context of time and culture. Usually the more emotional the communication is, the less reserved the author becomes in speaking in their own natural voice and so you can get a very austere look into how their personal sense of language has developed over their life span. Even a sample size of one person gives you an interesting background on a country's ethnography. This is also why I have such a hard-on for graffiti. It's not about the "art." It's about language and semiotics. I'll just post the full note in case anyone who speaks Serbo-Croatian wants to know what it says. **All I ask is that you don't tell me what it says!** ![2013_05_04_17_21_04_by_fartprincess-d645da2](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/2013_05_04_17_21_04_by_fartprincess-d645da2.jpg) ![2013_05_04_17_37_27_by_fartprincess-d645e31](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/2013_05_04_17_37_27_by_fartprincess-d645e31.jpg) I understand some of it without having to consult a dictionary. One of the girls had a boyfriend who she was deciding to break up with so that she could be with another guy. Her friend was judiciously telling her that if she did this, she may ruin any chance she had of being with him (Momirom? Another reason my friend thought they were gypsies, not a common local name) again because she'd have fucked it up YET AGAIN. But she's all flippant about it, much as any 19-year-old might be. They also talk about a local nightclub here in Belgrade called Blaywatch. I thought that was funny. I think it's one of those boat night clubs my friends were telling me about, so I wonder if the owner thought it was like, a spin on Baywatch :) The cryptic math-like thing on the back is probably some sort of childish "love calculator" type business. I think. One thing I wouldn't mind knowing, from anyone, is the meaning of the last word, "iskulirala." My friend says it's slang but didn't know what it meant exactly. I tried to Google it for some context, but was grasping at straws. [Edit: [Robert Basic](https://twitter.com/robertbasic) was kind enough to let me know that it often means "chill out" but here it means to not pay attention to someone] 

# Food

Yesterday, I got the honor of eating zimska salama, Hungarian winter salami. It has this odd white powdery coating on the casing, which turns out to be mold. But it's good mold--you could feasibly eat it if you wanted to. I also got to take home the leftovers :D And then promptly realized I didn't have a very good knife for cutting it so I was stuck cutting it with a very dull steak knife. I hope I'm not offending the local "foodies" by sharing this awkward cutting of meat: ![2013_05_05_07_10_34_hdr_by_fartprincess-d645f3i](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/2013_05_05_07_10_34_hdr_by_fartprincess-d645f3i.jpg) I also had the Croatian drink that I did not actually drink in Croatia, Cedevita. I remember seeing people ordering it in cafes. It would come in little packets to be mixed with water... it was like someone drinking Tang and I kind of laughed at it. It's like a multi-vitamin drink... unlike Tang. I didn't really like it, though. I'd much rather have had water.
