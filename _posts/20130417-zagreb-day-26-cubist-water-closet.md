# Zagreb, Day 26: Cubist Water Closet

Today, Ivor and I went to see the Picasso exhibit at Galerija KloviÄ‡eri dvori with a friend here. They have been pushing the Picasso exhibit pretty hard ever since I got here. I've seen Picasso's most famous works split between MoMA (NYC), the Met (NYC), and Museu Picasso (Barcelona), so this was hardly a life-changing experience for me, but still fun. My friend was disappointed with the number of works available, but I looked at it the other way... they had an entire floor of the gallery dedicated to his works. I thought that was quite the testament to how prolific he was, that he has so much work that it's dispersed so thoroughly around the world as it is, even though so much of it is borrowed from Paris.  I like Picasso, though. I'm not much an art buff. But did you know that the artistic direction in Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island was inspired by Picasso's cubist period... or that I just made that up but you still kind of believed it anyway? But for real, I like it when an artist has plenty of photography of themselves available and you can see their personality exposed. Picasso seems like he was kind of a relaxed dude. Wandering around in open cabana shirts, a cigar in one hand with a really svelte swagger, a glancing nod to the camera that says, "Yeah I'm like some well-respected art dude, deal with it." I like to judge for myself who an artist is, not what some asshole tour guide decides is important. You can see a lot in someone's eyes, sometimes the things they're not telling you. 

# The WC

Leaving the gallery, I had to use the bathroom. I noticed on the ground floor there was a sign for "WC." I said aloud, "Oh, W-C... that way... okay." I said W.C. with emphasis because I was laughing to myself about it. It's a sign that is plastered all over Europe but you will not see it in the United States. There, you will see signs for the bathroom or restroom. Because of this, I associate "W.C." with 19th century outhouses. A few moments after I said "W-C", my friend asked, "What are you saying?" I said aloud to myself, "W-C? Water closet? That's... what the sign says." He said, "That's weird. Why would you say it like that?" I was really confused, "Why _wouldn't_ I say it like that? I'm speaking in English and that's how you pronounce those two letters in English." "Well, here, we pronounce it differently." I was now more confused. Because I wasn't speaking Croatian... if I am speaking English, why wouldn't I pronounce them like English letters? This friend isn't dumb, so I couldn't figure out if there was something I was missing here. 

# Nomadic Philosophy

I'm going to Belgrade soon. I don't know anything about Belgrade. I have an apartment waiting for me there. That's about as much as I know. And that's how I'm going to keep it. People keep questioning my entire philosophy on travel. I feel like a broken record sometimes telling people repeatedly, "Just pack your fucking bag and go. You don't need to plan it and you don't need to take anything with you other than yourself, your clothes, and a sense of wanderlust." Every single extra thing you take with you, every plan you make, all of those things just weigh you down! For anyone new reading this, let me explain that me coming to Croatia is not the first time I've done something like this. Last spring, I uprooted myself, threw out or sold everything I owned, and lived in Paris on my own and then Barcelona. These were some of the most personally defining moments I've ever lived. But I was laying in bed the other night, thinking, and I remembered that me coming here was completely whimsical. I didn't put much thought into it at all. I didn't really plan it aside from picking the day I left. I didn't know anything about Zagreb before coming here. I didn't bother reading up on it or even looking at the map. I didn't plan out anything I was going to do. I didn't pick a definite length of time I'd be staying. I figured there was more mystery and adventure to unfold going in blind. Walking around after the gallery, I saw these upright posts. "What exactly are those for?" "Those are for you to lean on while you wait for the bus." They're as tall as me. If you laid them out horizontally, they could seat 2-3 people. Leaning against this post did not make my feet feel comforted in any way. It did successfully assist me in looking like James Dean. Or a hooker. It's all in the lean. ![leaningpost_by_fartprincess-d622qjt](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/leaningpost_by_fartprincess-d622qjt.jpg)

> Chris Stromsoe 5:34: you look like an italian movie hooker. Chris Stromsoe 5:34: whose husband died and you're raising your two children in some tragi-comedy. Chris Stromsoe 5:34: and you're about to meet colin firth.

But seriously, a leaning pole is such a waste. 

# Driving

Tonight, Beyonce had a concert at the Arena, which is about 100 meters away from Luka's apartment. I was sitting out on the balcony doing some work, observing all the chaos down on the street below. An emergency vehicle started to come around the roundabout by the arena. But no one really moved out of the way. Luka made his own observation that in the US, people will come to a complete stop and let emergency vehicles pass through, whereas here, people seem to continue driving almost the same as normal. I don't know if the observation about the U.S. drivers is always true. I feel like there are times where people just switch into the right lane, continue driving, and let the emergency vehicle pass on the left. I sometimes wish I could get a taste of the driving myself but I didn't get my international driver's license prior to leaving. I probably should have. Oh well.
