# Belgrade, Day 17: Mihailova

Last night, I was going downstairs to the store directly below my apartment. It's a tiny little place. The girl inside is young and doesn't speak any English other than "OK." I can typically have an exchange in Serbian (or Croatian) if the person speaks some English. They have an understanding of my own language enough to know how to set a pace when speaking so that I can sort of pick out words I know and fill in the blanks with context. However, when someone does not speak any English, they will usually speak in their natural demeanor and it becomes difficult, if not impossible, to catch what they are saying with my primary skills in the language. Such is the case with this girl.  However, no emotion was lost between us. She was nervous to have me in the store but when she saw me smile at her, she suddenly loosened up. And as I was leaving the store, she sort of grabbed my arm unexpectedly and pointed a couple of times at my wrist. I was wearing one of the Serbian arm bands I got Saturday. I laughed, she smiled, and suddenly, beyond anything I could imagine, she gave me a double thumbs up. I know i'm a huge dork for it but I get a kick out of wearing stuff like this as a costume. I rarely hold on to things like this. I had a gas mask that I got in Berlin, took it back to the US, and left it in its canister under the bed of the place I stayed in Portland. I'm not sure where this hat will end up but I like to think it'll be somewhere good. ![bkogpnecqaa_yp0_by_fartprincess-d658ehf](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/bkogpnecqaa_yp0_by_fartprincess-d658ehf.jpg) I realized, from people's enthusiastic response to the arm bands (not so much the hat, I haven't worn that in public really), as I've been aware many times already, that sarcasm, while being generally a satirical technique of western civilization, so thoroughly permeates through and oversaturates American culture that I sometimes feel slightly defensive when someone says something positive here, especially when it is coming from someone I don't really know. This is not to say that Americans are not polite to one another ever, but that if someone gave you a double thumbs up on something you were wearing on the street, it'd be just as likely that they were making fun of you as they were complimenting you--it's all contextual. But here, no one will directly approach you to make fun of you like that. You'll be met with sneers from complete strangers and with others if you don't fit in and people will politely wait to laugh at you behind your back. Is one culture doing it more "right" than the other? Nah. I went to the history museum but it wasn't open so I wandered around Kalemegdan and then Knez Mihailova. Mid-day seems different in Belgrade from Zagreb. In Zagreb, you'd see all these people in the main square drinking coffee in the middle of the day. Here, not so much, aside from people will small children. People are walking but they all look like they're heading somewhere. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d658eat](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d658eat.jpg) ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d658edk](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d658edk.jpg) ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d658eec](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d658eec.jpg) ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d658emr](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d658emr.jpg) ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d658enh](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d658enh.jpg) ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d658eou](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d658eou.jpg) ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d658ejp](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d658ejp.jpg) ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d658ei8](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d658ei8.jpg) People do sit in parks a lot more though, just talking. I liked the above picture just because you have two old females friends by two young female friends. This behavior transcends age. Old people here can be kind of sad. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d658eiy](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d658eiy.jpg) This is an old beggar, but many older women who are not in this position have similar postures. Not sure if it's poor nutrition, inadequate healthcare, a rough life of labor, or some combination of the three. They always seems to be in good spirits though. Taking this photo was a bit difficult for me because even as unreserved as I am about documenting my stay, I felt awkward objectifying this woman for her physical state of being, almost like I was making light of it when really I was thinking the exact opposite. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d658eer](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d658eer.jpg) Inside the park, there were young pre-pubescent girls playing some game where one of them threw a stick and then ran to where it landed. The girls waiting to take their turn would play rok, papir, makaze (not sure if I'm getting that last word correct--word for scissors). ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d658eks](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d658eks.jpg) ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d658ebx](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d658ebx.jpg) I thought this was a cool idea, but there was nothing inside. It's a plywood "library" in which you leave a book and take a book in exchange. Yet there was nothing inside. Someone has to make that initial deposit. No one has. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d658elq](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d658elq.jpg)
