# Zagreb, Day 24: Pizza, In Profession

Today was an uneventful for day for me, but one full of thoughts and thinking. I have to start thinking about my plans for leaving Zagreb. Shortly before I left the US, I had sent my landlord an e-mail letting him know my plans to travel abroad. In response, he told me that he was planning on selling my apartment. Wow. But legally, whoever owns the apartment has to respect my lease. A couple of weeks after I left, he had found buyers. The buyers want for their college-age daughter to move in. They want me to prematurely end my lease. This is good news for me. I don't like being stuck in long leases and I like traveling. But it's posed the question to me of where I want to go once I come "home." I have made friends in Austin. But a large piece of me thinks, "Man, how awesome would it be to go visit Brooklyn while it's still warm?" or "I could totally go surfing in Hawaii."  I am defined by these restless legs. I've had them for so long and never understood what they were until I really got out there and saw the world. Zagreb has gotten smaller for me. It is still interesting to me. There is still plenty to learn. But the overall "mystery" of it has been solved. I feel comfortable walking the streets. I know how social interactions are supposed to work. I kind of have a fair perspective (from an outsider) of what people are like. I've had a few moments where people were explaining something to me and I actually thought, "yeah yeah, I know." This morning, as I was walking outside, I actually saw someone I knew. From here. And stopped and had an interaction with her. I felt comfortable. I like Zagreb though. The people can be pretentious in ways but the city itself is not. It's unassuming. I plan to move on to Belgrade next. I want to see the Serbian side of the story. It's odd because there is so much hostility here towards Serbia, not even fueled by hatred, just innate, unexposed caution, fear, uncertainty... from people who I would not expect it from... that I feel the surge of it myself sometimes. I forget, "I'm American. I am completely neutral in this story." I'm American. I don't have a timely reference to war that has any significance to me. My country's recent wars have been fought far from home and have been declared on abstract things rather than countries. The war on terror. The war on drugs. We don't have wars. We have "political conflicts." Seeing countries that are situated next to one another filled with vitriol gives me a startling perspective on things. Realistically, I can't tell any difference between the Serbs and the Croats. Their two languages are extremely similar. They have similar cultures. But there is division. More from the Croats than the Serbs (obviously because the Croats were the ones fighting for independence). I know that kind of remark might be completely offensive to either nationality, but as an outsider, it's not wrong for me to think that there is a cultural blending between two nations that are positioned next to one another geographically. On a side note, I found out the other day that I am staying here illegally. I was supposed to register with the police here. When I go to Serbia, I am supposed to obtain some sort of white card which indicates that I have registered with the police. Anyone could ask me for this card at any point during my stay and I'm supposed to show it. I have no idea if I will have any trouble leaving Croatia without it. I doubt it though. When I visited Péru, I had this Andean migration card. I knew I was supposed to keep it, but given that it was just a flimsy piece of printer paper, I didn't think much of its importance. When I passed through immigrations on leaving, I didn't have it. They wouldn't let me leave. It was 11 at night and they were demanding that I pay for it. Only with cash. In Soles. There were no ATMs nearby. I didn't know what to do. But then I managed, after 20 minutes of digging through my stuff, to find the 8 Soles they requested (this is like $3 USD). Silly. Tonight, I had pizza with ketchup on it finally. Prior to ordering it, I asked Luka about it some more. He thought it was a completely normal thing, but I remarked back, "No, it's really weird! It's not like tomato sauce because it's cold!" I said something about it being sweet. He said ketchup here wasn't sweet. So I had some ketchup from the fridge. It was noticeably less sweet. But see, tomato sauce on a pizza is not like ketchup. It has spices and herbs in it. It's not just tomato. The pizza showed up and the ketchup was in a coffee cup. ![ketchup_by_fartprincess-d61ul51](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/ketchup_by_fartprincess-d61ul51.jpg) What? ![ketchupizza_by_fartprincess-d61ul4q](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/ketchupizza_by_fartprincess-d61ul4q.jpg) I ate it though. I wasn't really a fan. I mean, it wasn't bad. It just felt like a pizza that would have been really good but was awkward because someone spilled something out of place on it. Why is there cold goopy ketchup on it? I'm pretty sure I'm not eating a hot dog. And I'm not picky with food at all. I am probably one of the most open-minded eaters I know. I used to eat ketchup on macaroni and cheese. In a way this reminded me of one of my friends telling me when he was in the military and stationed in west Africa, it was common to serve canned vegetables with huge slops of mayonaise. This is also reminding me of an ongoing debate I had about whether egg can work with anything (I'm always looking for the correct counterexample to that). I'm mostly just curious where this ketchup trend originated. It seems to be an east Europe thing based on my brief excursion with Google. The title of this entry comes from the awkward mistranslation I got from Paesano's menu. "umak od pelata, gauda, mozzarella, šunka, u štruci." They translated "u štruci" as "in profession," but I was told this was actually just slang and that it was indicating that the pizza is not actually a pizza, but a calzone. Learning the language more has been useful because when I see sentences or phrases, I have a better sense for the mood even if I don't immediately get what is being said. For example, this sentence is just 2 words, the first being "Ja" ("I"). I know it's going to be some very succinct message then. And it is. It's saying, "I am growing." ![jarastem_by_fartprincess-d61umtp](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/jarastem_by_fartprincess-d61umtp.jpg) Maybe I notice it less in the US, but graffiti here is less about art and more about making a statement. People write a lot. Sometimes, they write in English: ![iloveoyu_by_fartprincess-d61un8o](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/iloveoyu_by_fartprincess-d61un8o.jpg)
