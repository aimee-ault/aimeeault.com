# Novi Sad, Day 2: Petrovaradin

Yesterday, I unexpectedly wound up in Novi Sad at Petrovardin Fortress. I didn't plan for it at all--it just kind of happened. And it was a very strange (yet good) experience. I took off a week from journaling because I spent most of last week doing a lot of work (but on the plus side, if you are a user of DreamUp, expect some awesome shit next week :)) and spending some time with friends not really doing anything worthy of being written about publicly. But yesterday I got out and had some fun for the first time since I got back from Greece. 

# Train Stations

At the train station, I was met with a lot of xenolinguophobists. Even the people at the information desk were unwilling to help me. I just needed to know which track to go to for my train. There were 11 tracks total at Beograd's main railway station and none of them were labeled. Train stations in general are a bit unfamiliar for me because Americans don't spend much time on trains. There's a lot of vocabulary but it's sort of vague to me. Like I know voz means train and kola means car but that's where my knowledge ends. It's weird to me that we make sure information in airports is cleanly communicated to accomodate international travelers but train stations fail at that in so many ways. 

# Weird Toilets

While I was waiting for the train, I went to the bathroom. The train station bathroom was pay-to-use. I hadn't come across this in Serbia until yesterday. Actually, I had, but I didn't understand then that it was pay-to-use and just sort of stormed past the attendant who didn't bother saying anything. This guy was very ready to get my 30 Dinar (this is like 30 cents USD). I fished 20 Dinar out but I couldn't find 10 more without breaking a 1000 Dinar bill. No one likes breaking 1000 Dinar bills unless you have exact change to break it cleanly into a 500 or something. The guy eventually grew annoyed with me going through my bag and just let me go. The inside of the bathroom was unlike any bathroom I have ever been in in my life. I at first though I had walked into the men's bathroom. It was broken into 20 rooms and there were no toilets, just holes in the floor for you to squat over that had continuously running water going through them. I thought about how awkward it must be for someone that had to do anything more than pee. Or for any woman that was more high-maintenance than me. I imagined a woman in a business suit squatting to take a leak over one of these ridiculous holes. The floors were wet, yet it seemed clean inside. When I got on the train, a man and a woman sat a few seats away from me and I overheard, "Necesitas subir los fotos." The weird thing about this moment was that hearing these words, I first thought I was hearing English because I didn't take any time to parse meaning or do any internal translation. The meaning was immediately there and my first feeling was comfort because I thought, "I am hearing a language I know and speak," and so I turned back to them and laughed a second and said, "Estoy sorprendida a oírte hablar en español!" and was happy to finally confirm with someone, "Vamos a Novi Sad?" and get the relief I needed when the man, still sort of surprised by me, said back, "Si." The train ride overall was quiet. We passed through Novi Beograd, Nova Pazova, Stara Pazova, Beška, and a few other stops. It was mostly countryside. Occasionally, we would pass through small villages overlooking soccer games and people picking flowers or berries with their dogs. I thought about what a weird life it must be to live in Beška and have your whole life be beautiful as it is, but so simple and probably sheltered in some way. It's not a life I could ever live. I went to Petrovaradin Fortress. It is similar in some ways to Kalemegdan, even being situated on the Danube in the same fashion, but is much larger, I believe. My favorite parts of Petrovaradin were the ones I had to go off the beaten path to discover, ones that seemed untouched by the masses, like the underground passages used for countermine development during siege warfare. The tunnel I discovered on my way there, outside of the main park. A desire path (a naturally produced dirt path made by wear and tear of human footprints) had been formed leading into a thicket. As you push through all the brush, thinking it will lead nowhere, you are taken to the outer edge of one part of the fortress which is only connected to the main part by way of these underground tunnels. Getting inside of the tunnel was scary because there was a 5' drop and I wasn't sure if I'd be able to get back out. i figured I could scale 5 feet of brick though and worst case, I'd have my phone with me in an emergency, so I took the plunge (literally): ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d66jdrw](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d66jdrw.jpg) This fortress is old. Like 17th century. In some parts, not these parts, they had added fortifications to support the walls from collapsing in. Occasionally, you could look up and see above-ground entrances through manholes. This was a lot like exploring the Parisian Catacombs but much drier, cleaner, and airier. This shouldn't be a huge surprise though, because Petrovaradin is actually modeled after French fortress design. I had a lot of fun. Getting out was not too difficult either, aside from all the dirt that collected under my fingernails (but hey, what's having fun if you don't have to clean up afterwards :)) ![7e88f09ac5d711e2b3af22000a1fb856_7_by_fartprincess-d66mbdf](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/7e88f09ac5d711e2b3af22000a1fb856_7_by_fartprincess-d66mbdf.jpg) **Did You Know:** I am actually a calico cat in human form. This area has been untouched, the grass and everything, as you can see above, was at my hip level. This is part of the outer defense line of the fortress, not really part of the upper or lower level, which is accessible a bit more inland. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d66jdlh](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d66jdlh.jpg) ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d66jd71](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d66jd71.jpg) Although this fortress was built by the Austrians in the end of the 17th century after defeating the Turks, the location of Petrovaradin has a very long history which is documented back to 100 AC. I am impressed by the fortress because it hasn't been massively landscaped, which is often what happens with these historical preservations. As can be seen above, the wildlife is left to do what it wants, which is, in short, gorgeous. I like to get off trails though. I found myself at an overlook that was not very accessible. I felt like I was walking into someone's little mysterious secret, like it had been an established overlook for anyone who looks for romantically cryptic puzzles. Purple and red flowers scattered throughout the field of high grass, bees floating everywhere. It was a bit of a hike, but, fuck, it was worth it. ![green_grass_of_tunnel_by_fartprincess-d66ji3s](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/green_grass_of_tunnel_by_fartprincess-d66ji3s.jpg)
