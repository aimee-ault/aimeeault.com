# Stockholm, Day 6: The Art of Story-Telling

Depending on where I am staying, I occasionally will jokingly describe to friends that staying in a particular place feels like being an "infestation." It's not a negative thing to me. After all, I doubt a family of roaches knows that their presence is unwanted in your home--but yet they still stealthily dart and weave through crack and crevice in dark shadow, indestructible creatures of the night. Now that you are picturing me as a bug (which is all that I ever wanted) let's move on.  Sometimes friends ask me, vaguely, what's the best thing I've seen in my travels or what's the best place I've been. I can barely even answer "what's your favorite food," much less pick a single treasured moment across the 13 countries I've been to, but I don't fault people for asking it because I assume there was a time when I could have answered it, when every moment of my life didn't bleed together in a quilt of color, language, and prismatic saturation like my life has in the past couple of years. To pinpoint one thing in particular that stands out most to me is to take it all for granted... and more than that, the imagery that stands out most to me in my travels is not the most visually breathtaking stuff. The truth is that the places I treasure the most are places I feel are unguarded secrets, places that are not necessarily beautiful to the eye, but mysteriously unoccupied passages haunted by other people's transient memories, a dirtied little nook off a trail where a soiled shawl sits in the mud by two empty cans, overlooking a cliff. A grueling, daunting rocky hike through thorny brush that outputs to a sunset so great that I can't look away or walk away. Or a tunnel burrowed out by industrious street artists speaking only a language of action to one another, words that stretch through time, where one person finds the secret and simply knows that another person just like them has trekked there before and feels a sense of brotherhood with adventurers they have never met and may never meet. Where some people see a barrier, others see sport. Last night, I was in Vanadislunden. It was quiet, around 10PM. The sun hadn't set yet. Two guys were boxing on a hill. A woman was off in a stretch of the park alone reading. And I was wandering the edges of the park when I saw a fray in the fencing and fell down the rabbit hole. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d68zmee](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d68zmee.jpg) I didn't know what it was, or where it was going to take me. But I just ran. I don't know what any of this was. It was made of a weird sheet rock structure that was splitting and breaking. No one had maintained it. It wasn't part of the park. It looked like a really huge, oversized water slide. It wrapped around corners and went down. I slipped a couple of times. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d68zmm2](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d68zmm2.jpg) The further I went, the more I felt like, "I'm not welcome here but the mystery is so enticing that I can't turn back." It ended anticlimactically at a deserted swimming pool, but from there, standing before me was all this brilliant pink and blue and orange. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d68zmuw](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d68zmuw.jpg) Today, I had lunch at a place called Gondalen. It's on the 11th floor of a building and it overlooks the Stockholm waterfront. It's supposed to bear one of the best views of the city (I'd liken it to Seattle's Space Needle, only not architecturally interesting--just the concept of a restaurant renowned for its view more than its food). The restaurant had an ambience I wasn't expecting. It was fancier than I thought it would be but the waiter was this guy that looked like Uncle Fester from the Addams Family and he was very sweet regardless of my underdressed appearance. Several people came in, two well-dressed guys sat down by me and one asked about "pommes frites" (French fries) and I started to ask them if that's how they're referred to here, because "pommes" is sort of the standard European way to refer to them and that sent me on a big train of thought about the fact that Americans call them French fries... so did they actually originate in France? The two guys were egging on my weird fascination, egging on my natural inclination to conduct research and before I knew it, we were of the understanding that French fries originated in Belgium, not France and that "French fries" are called as so because American soldiers in World War I were dumb and assumed that if someone spoke French, they were from France. As I returned to my food, I started scoping out the rest of the room, when I caught eyes with two younger people who looked, like me, very out of place, them more so than me though. But no one was treating them any differently. But I recognized something in the eyes of the boy. He had a ravenous look in his face, like someone who hadn't been fed in a long time. And he was shoveling food in his mouth faster than I've ever seen anyone eat. He was starving. His entire appearance, I couldn't stop looking. Every detail about him, I just wanted to write it all down. He had a t-shirt on that said "ALCATRAZ" in huge block letters. His lips were very full and his hair hung in his eyes like a shaggy dog. He had a dirty look to him. Vladimir Nabokov wrote in his novel, Lolita, about how you identify nymphettes at a young age. It's been a long time since I read the book, but I remember he described them as being not the prettiest girls in the class. It's usually a tomboy. She looks rough around the edges, maybe scrapes on her legs from playing outside, and some sort of coy look underneath her eyes. I think I was maybe 14 when I read this, so it disturbed me at the time to think that some man might be looking at me like this because I certainly fit Nabokov's definition of someone who was going to grow up to be some sort of nymphomaniac. But I could see some sort of undertone in this teen boy that bothered me. Not the same thing, mind you, just something unsettling under the seams that drew attention, like a weird out of place puzzle. Like someone who wasn't from around here. Like me, a vagrant. Like a dirty roach who has made his way somehow into something nice, and is taking all this food for bounty because he doesn't know when he'll see more again. His friend less interesting, more predictable, I think. It was nothing about him. Just whatever energy dispersed between his bones that made me think, made me question what I see when I people-watch. Because my eyes tend to skip over the boring and are looking for a non-verbal narrative. Everywhere I go, people share this one thing in common. Appearances change, but everyone seems to be telling a story. For what it's worth, I feel out of place in Stockholm. Like a bug. The city is expensive and it makes me not want to do anything. It's a beautiful place but on principle alone, I just want to move on. I identified more with the two disheveled kids digging through their fries than any of the glamor I see elsewhere. My life asks to be physically challenged and something here just doesn't give me that... I'm not upset though. It's just contrast I am happy to see. Everywhere I go gives me this unique opportunity to experience the culture of people and to reach out to others and experience first-hand something outside of who I am. So that is not an opportunity I feel has gone wasted. It just builds up my anticipation of better things on the horizon.
