# Zagreb, Day 29: Fuck Authority

Today, I was walking down Ilica and I was violently rocked by a loud explosion suddenly. I was only a block away from the Grič Cannon. I knew that the cannon is fired every day at noon. However, I have never been in the city center at noon. I also cannot remember the last time I was near a cannon being fired, but from close by, the noise doesn't have the sort of precision punch you normally would associate with a cannon blast and so it just sounds like a generically large projectile explosion. The other night, a disgruntled Croatian war veteran threw a grenade into a local coffee house in Zagreb, injuring 7 people. Hearing this sudden blast sent me jumping a little into the wall. The streets were packed and I noticed many other people doing the same thing.  There's some ridiculous legend about this cannon that the first time it was fired, the cannon ball shot across the Sava River and hit a rooster that a Turkish chef was about to cook. I can't picture this without picturing that the Turkish chef is actually the Swedish chef from Jim Henson's Muppet Show. 

# I'm Not Your Little Bitch (Fuck Authority)

I rented a bike for a second time. Doing this took more time than I anticipated. It is hard to find a bike rental place that isn't by the hour. Eventually, I stopped into the tourism office and asked where the best place to go would be. The woman directed me to something called "Henrik." Henrik was not a bike store, however. It was a hostel. And it had all these different buildings associated with it, one being a bar. I asked the bartender about the bike rental and he said, "You want to rent the bike? I will need your passport." I said, "It's required? Okay, bye." And walked away. If Zagreb has taught me one thing about traveling, it's that I should stand up for myself more and not get pushed around. I hate authority and I don't like giving my passport number out to random businesses. So I don't do that, especially knowing there was another bike rental place in town that wouldn't take my passport number. The only reason I didn't go there first was because all of the bikes there were too big for me the first time. 

# Mountain Bikes

But I ended up back there, at Žuti Mačak (which I later found out means "Yellow Cat"). The woman working there recognized me immediately and remembered me by name. I am assuming that was a good thing because she was very friendly with me. I ended up with a mountain bike this time. Not by choice. It just literally was the only bike that came close to fitting my small size, and even then, with the seat post lowered to the lowest point, was still slightly too tall for me. No one in Zagreb really rides road bikes. I love road bikes. I like commuter/coaster bikes too if I'm in the mood. But mountain bikes have a very unusual stigma back in the US of being the bike of choice of the uninitiated ignorant slob. At the same time, I also laugh at the other end of the spectrum, people who wear ridiculous bicycle attire as if they were in the Tour de France. But here, everyone rides mountain bikes. I can maybe understand why given the condition of the sidewalks... it's almost like riding mountainous terrain. I was happy to have the bike, though. It takes very, very little to make me happy. Maybe 3 or 4 things: Sun/good weather, a bike, my health, a purpose. Riding around on a bike, especially on my own, I'm at peace with myself. Just me, a fresh breeze, and my thoughts. Then later, that awesome feeling where my body is exhausted but my mind sharper than ever, ready to write all the code in the world. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d62ekcm](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d62ekcm.jpg) Of course, my "health" is a little at odds. When I got here, I commented on how Novi Zagreb has these big open areas between housing. Once the snow melted and the weather warmed up, I discovered that these big open fields are big open dandelion meadows. Sometimes there are other flowers too. They're gorgeous, sure, but they make me sneeze! When I sneeze, I will sneeze anywhere between 3 and 12 times. In a really, really high-pitched girly squeal. When I am on a bike, this is kind of a horrifying mess. 

# Advertising

I've been noticing some things about Croatian outdoor advertising. Maybe the US is like this as well and I've just never noticed it. The ads here often have this weird spin on the nuclear family. I can't really understand it. The family dynamic here must be different from how it is in the US, but I can't say how since I've not really observed anyone's family here. But the ads all focus on humor around familial situations. One had an older man being restrained by his wife as he approached another family member sitting on a couch, his arms held out as if he were going to strangle the guy on the couch (for being sloth). The one I noticed today was also sort of a "ha-ha" take on nuclear family: Wife is kind of the "center" of the family, keeping shit running, husband is dressed as if he's the "provider" white-collar guy yet obviously is a klutz. Kid is also a total messy nightmare who the mom has to nurture. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d62el8i](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d62el8i.jpg) The ads are so simplistic and uncomplicated, unlike American ads. So when I see them, I end up filling in my own commentary. It's so easy. Thanks for that, Croatia. When I see the above, all I hear is the woman thinking, "Why the fuck did I marry this clumsy retard and bear his horrible retard spawn and lose all sense of rationale and feed our kid a consistent diet of neon-colored juices despite the fact that we idiotically moved into this pure snow white house?" Ha-ha, get it, everything is all perfectly organized "when you need it most" while your stupid husband is getting wrecked by blue balls (ha-ha, you walked right into that one, Samsung). 

# Religion

When I came back this afternoon, I went to sit out on the balcony to get some writing done. Luka came out and started talking to me about these minor personality differences in people geographically, like how people at the eastern border are one way, people at the coast are another way. Part of this was that some regions are vastly more religious/Catholic than others. It's weird for me to think of religion in other countries. I've said it many times before, but I'm not religious in any way. I was raised in a completely atheist home and had evolution and the big bang explained to me at a very young age. I was taught to appreciate the unknown, but to understand that the unknown always holds the possibility of becoming known through the merits of the scientific method. I do respect my parents for that much. They were smart enough to give me that and I will always value it. But because of that, I grew up looking at the Bible Belt I lived in, thinking "it does not get worse than this." And yet it does. Hearing Luka talk about how schools here do not offer any form of sexual education and how the public schools have "religion" class. He said it was optional, but growing up, he was one of only a small handful that didn't go to it and was bullied as a result of that.
