# Zagreb, Day 18: Chess-Playing Unicorn

Today I went to Muzej Mimara, an art museum. I was hoping to see Croatian art but it was strictly Njemačka (Germany), Venecija (Venice), Francuska (France), Katalonija (Catalonia... there was oddly no work from Spain proper), and a few other major countries. Yet nothing from Croatia. I wondered if that was intentional, because art museums want to project that they have influence and if you don't have anything "worldly," then what do you have? So instead I saw like, chamberpots from the Byzantine Empire or some Baroque era pewter spoon rest from Venice.  I got a student discount because the ticket person insisted that I was a student. This was a nice way to start my day. A lot of the museum was religious art that does not interest me in any way, not even from a fictionalized perspective. Religious art actually really gets under my skin because there's so much of it. I think, "What awesome shit could this person have been sculpting if they hadn't wasted their time on something as derivative and cliche as Mary Magdalene?" What would they have said if they had the freedom to artistically express themselves without the fear of retribution? Some people say with sculpture, it's not about the subject though, the art is in the craft itself. And I can see that, definitely, but you can do some really complex shit with sculpture rather than just make a bust of some religious talking head making the most neutral-looking face in the world: ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d60zxcy](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d60zxcy.jpg) Just to get the form of 3 separate bodies together to create the play of light and dark like is happening there is really something neat. Or what I think is supposed to be a tribute to the Lion of Lucerne: ![lionoflucerne_by_fartprincess-d60zzvq](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/lionoflucerne_by_fartprincess-d60zzvq.jpg) I only know of that because it's a fairly famous statue in Switzerland, only there, the lion rests in a cave as he weeps and dies. Hundreds of Swiss mercenaries were brutally slaughtered during the French Revolution after Louis XVI had a total shitfit (that's what they write in the history books, trust me). So it was cool to see that! Also... "Lady's Writing Desk": ![ladyswriting_by_fartprincess-d6100t3](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/ladyswriting_by_fartprincess-d6100t3.jpg) ![ladysdesk_by_fartprincess-d6100xh](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/ladysdesk_by_fartprincess-d6100xh.jpg) I store my panties, lingerie, and multitude of vibrators in the lockable drawers (obviously). The second floor of the museum was nothing but paintings and none of them were interesting to me, just portraits and religious pieces. **In lieu of that, here's a bunch of Instagram photos from throughout my day:** ![i1_by_fartprincess-d610463](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/i1_by_fartprincess-d610463.jpg) ![60249d288e4d11e2a42922000a9e51c4_7_by_fartprincess-d610703](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/60249d288e4d11e2a42922000a9e51c4_7_by_fartprincess-d610703.jpg) ![i5_by_fartprincess-d61044k](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/i5_by_fartprincess-d61044k.jpg) ![i4_by_fartprincess-d61044r](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/i4_by_fartprincess-d61044r.jpg) ![i3_by_fartprincess-d610455](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/i3_by_fartprincess-d610455.jpg) ![i2_by_fartprincess-d61045f](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/i2_by_fartprincess-d61045f.jpg) ![i6_by_fartprincess-d61044d](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/i6_by_fartprincess-d61044d.jpg) ![i7_by_fartprincess-d610440](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/i7_by_fartprincess-d610440.jpg) ![i9_by_fartprincess-d61043j](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/i9_by_fartprincess-d61043j.jpg) The waffle was from Maisson de Waffle. They had a "Zagreb" waffle but it was with Nutella and I burnt out on Nutella last year. ![i8_by_fartprincess-d61043q](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/i8_by_fartprincess-d61043q.jpg) Someone suggested that I title this series of journals as the "Pink Shoe Diaries" but that sounds too close to Cinemax's "Red Shoe Diaries," which was like some softcore porn with David Duchovney from the 90s. 

# New Words

Today I learned some new words in Croatian, but the two most important were šahovska and jednorog. That's chess and unicorn. So I could hypothetically tell you a story about a chess-playing unicorn. I pick up new words constantly. I'm like a sponge. I see the word "soba" over and over again in the museum. It means room of course! I'm not trying to learn the words, but that's how immersion works. Through repetition, the words force themselves into your brain. It's powerful and beautifully endearing to see my brain absorbing new information while I'm busy with other things. It makes me feel happy, proud. Today, someone pulled up their motorcycle to me and told me, "Ti si mala." This means "you are small." But in my head, with my knowledge of Latin roots, I always hear that word as "bad." Mala is a funny adjective for me. Adjectives in Croatian have a lot of complexity as do nouns. There are different noun cases but for each noun case, there is an adjective form for it as well. Sometimes the adjective can be bare like velik or dobar, "big" and "good." Whereas "mali" is never bare, it always has some ending affixed to it [like, -i there, it can never just be "mal"]. All of this is really cool because it makes it more transparent that possessive adjectives are adjectives too. Plenty of native English speakers do not stop and think that a word like "my" is an adjective. But it is, it's possessive adjective. And it's really obvious that it is with Croatian.
