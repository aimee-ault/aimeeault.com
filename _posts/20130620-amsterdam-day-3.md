# Amsterdam, Day 3

Today I learned about the sentimental nickname for Amsterdam, Mokum (מקום). It's a Yiddish word that means "safe haven," "town," or if you look back to the Hebrew language, "place." and a few cities in Germany and the Netherlands are referred to this way. So Berlin is "Mokum Beis" ("The B Place"), Amsterdam is "Mokum Alef," ("The A Place") but if you ever hear someone just saying "Mokum," they are undoubtedly referring to Amsterdam. All of this came from a local Yiddish slang called Bargoens. Like Yiddish words often intermarry into American English ("schtick"), the same phenomenon can be seen in Dutch.  For example, the one that stood out to me... everyone knows the expression "Mazel tov!" which means "Good luck!" The Dutch word "tof" comes from that Yiddish word "tov." It means "good" or "great." It's a very easy way to look back at the history of the Jews in Amsterdam, the largest Jewish community in the Netherlands, home to Anne Frank and her family. So yeah, there's a lot more going on in Amsterdam than just its brothels and "coffee shops." Like scary wax women. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d69ut8d](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d69ut8d.jpg)

# Coffee Shops

I'll talk about the "coffee shops" some too, because it's interesting and I know people are probably curious, even though I'm what most people call "straight edge." (I don't do drugs--at all. I've never even smoked a nicotine cigarette in my entire life and I plan to keep it that way.) A "coffee shop," (I will always reference it in quotes so you know what I mean) does not sell coffee, but rather cannabis products, like marijuana and hashish. There's absolutely nothing discreet about these places. Much in the same fashion that anyone knows that a "Thai Massage" parlor open at 1AM has more going on than someone getting relief for their sore muscles, a "coffee shop" does not have the same quaint vibe that you will get from a coffee shop elsewhere, but usually has some sort of seedy vibe to it (pun not intended). I guess the city has come under a lot of legal scrutiny in the past few years, because while they still legally sell these products, even having menus for them, they're not allowed to advertise the things they sell outright. So what most people know of as "pot brownies" are ubiquitously referred to as "space cakes" here. The libertarian in me is fascinated with all of this. Although I have no personal interest in it, I don't agree with how much the United States regulates and enforces law on consumption of these substances. The illegality of drug trafficking comes with significant economic costs, not to mention it has many non-monetary costs as well, like violence. Its illegality also creates issues of corrupt authority figures who only contribute to the violence, which results in even fewer people feeling safe. But as I said, I have a very libertarian stance on this, because I don't like how the US over-regulates things either. Obviously, you have to draw lines in the sand somewhere to prevent things like DUIs and things that legitimately endanger the lives of others, but laws that affect and regulate people's ownership and private property kind of rattle me in many different directions (I grew up reading pro-Anarchy tracts and really wanted to try "unschooling" at some point, grew into adulthood and had my political views refined and shaped by maturity and practically, so I realize that my ideas are off-the-beaten for many). Amsterdam has its own drug problems though. There are junkies on the street that are constantly trying to sell naive tourists "the harder stuff," and from what I can take away from it, the "harder stuff," is likely to come at a higher cost and more likely to not be what they claim it is. Because Dutch law isn't a free-for-all either. Criminals have a monopoly on the cost of illegal psychedelic drugs. As a result, you will see a lot of crime in Amsterdam at night. But anyway, a "coffee shop" is a place where you buy the above "goods." A koffiehuis (Dutch for "coffee house") is where you would go if you wanted to drink coffee. If you can't tell the difference between the two, you probably have already visited the former ;) 

# Bikes

One of the things that interests me about Amsterdam is its bike culture. As I had mentioned before, there are dedicated bike tracks on every street, bike traffic signals, and bikes tend to get priority to other vehicles, even to the trams. In fact, pedestrian crosswalks rarely have a single walk/stop light, but 3 to 4 separate ones for each street crossing, 2 for bike tracks, 1 for tram tracks if that is present, and then one for auto traffic. This is what I meant when I said the city is not designed for pedestrians, because these lights are frequently not synchronized properly and crossing one street may take up to 5 minutes. Though it's not the worst design ever, because these crossings come very infrequently. I'd imagine it's because there isn't much auto traffic (comparatively anyway, there are still cars everywhere). The pedestrian crosswalk signals are some of the dumbed down I've seen: ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d69utdy](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d69utdy.jpg) In case you were planning on pressing it with your turgid dick. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d69utcf](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d69utcf.jpg) Because there is not enough rack space, bikes are usually locked by connecting the back wheel to the frame. If you're thinking, "How does that stop anyone from stealing it?" It doesn't. It just deters thieves. Most of the bikes here are completely unattractive and not worthy of being stolen anyway. Apparently it is common for people to drunkenly throw bikes locked up this way into the canal. There doesn't seem to be any bike law about lights or helmets. Statistically, however, you are more likely to be murdered in the US than you are to die on a bike in Amsterdam. I'd imagine its because people are more educated about bike safety and are more isolated from auto traffic (you're not going to get right-clipped riding around here). Amsterdam reports 6 bike deaths a year. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d69utaf](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d69utaf.jpg) ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d69utgj](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d69utgj.jpg) ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d69utfa](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d69utfa.jpg) ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d69uteu](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d69uteu.jpg)
