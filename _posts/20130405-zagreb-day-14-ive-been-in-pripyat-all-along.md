# Zagreb, Day 14: I've Been in Pripyat All Along!

I don't have any way to make today's entry look glamorous. I had a good day but every photo I have taken of Zagreb today looks horrifying, or as Bryan remarked, "Jesus. It looks like Pripyat. Did you have to carry a Geiger counter?" 

## Aimee's Little Corner of Whining about Weather and Admitting That She Only Loves Places Where It's Sunny and Above 25°C.

I'm not a fan of the weather in Zagreb since I got here. Even when the locals say "tomorrow is going to be sunny :D :D :D", no, no it's not. The Zagrebian sun I have seen is like what I imagine the sun to look like in a post-apocalyptic world. It's sort of a weird, washed-out kind of deal muted under a blanket of thick viscous haze (or at least that's what it has been!). Don't get me wrong. I lived in Portland, OR for quite a while, where it rains constantly for 9 months of the year. It was supposed to get warm and sunny and not-rainy back last April... but it just kept raining. And raining. It was unusual. And even though I loved Portland, it was just... you know, bad weather. So I'm not insulting Zagreb, just the weather. I'm an extremely hot-blooded person. I get cold when it drops below like, 65°F/18°C. I like wearing short shorts and short skirts with my thigh-high socks. I do not like wearing pants! I like wearing sweaters and jackets even less! An old friend of mine jokingly said to me on Twitter yesterday when I posted a photo of some flower blossoms that I was spoiling his image of Zagreb being like North Corel from Final Fantasy VII. 

# Tunnels

Anyway. While walking to get lunch, my legs got restless and I kept walking. I eventually ended up at one of the tunnels that takes you underground so that you can cross the street from below. The tunnels that do this sometimes have multiple entrances so they have this sort of hazy maze-like quality to them. Not that you would get lost in it, but that there are so many paths you could take. The first one I went in had so much graffiti in it. But what started my initial excavation of the tomb of graffiti was this little tree by the entrance: ![happylittletree_by_fartprincess-d60j0pb](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/happylittletree_by_fartprincess-d60j0pb.jpg) Someone drew this on paper. Colored it. Cut it out. And taped it to the wall. Whether it was part of someone's school project or some deliberate action, someone put time and thought into this little tree. Around this time I started to think about why I like graffiti. It's not about artistic value for me. I don't like planned street art installations usually. While the "art wall" in Zagreb is cool-looking, it's just nice to look at, but it doesn't leave my heart with the same palpable feeling as I encounter when I find something secret or spontaneous or something that is resonating very primal human feeling... something where someone is in the dark alone with a marker and scribbles on a bus station wall something so blunt yet deep about themselves that they could never feel safe sharing with anyone they love, and so they reserve it for an anonymous format. It's an anthropological thing. We associate it with people of a certain socioeconomic group, but it's anonymous. That person leaving that little tree could be an esteemed mathematician, a famous journalist, or nobody at all. Anyway, I liked this tunnel because it felt like there was no middle of the road and so much of it felt like it was left by young, upbeat kids. ![stopdrogi_by_fartprincess-d60j2wy](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/stopdrogi_by_fartprincess-d60j2wy.jpg) Stop drugs! With Super Mario :) ![imgettingoutofhere_by_fartprincess-d60j33f](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/imgettingoutofhere_by_fartprincess-d60j33f.jpg) I wanted to save this for when I leave Zagreb, but I couldn't hold back. In the middle there is a rat hanging on a balloon. This was right by the exit, so maybe it was someone making the simple remark that they were leaving the tunnel, but I like to think they were remarking that they were getting out of the city, their life, or some greater thing to be escaped. ![pursethief_by_fartprincess-d60j3bz](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/pursethief_by_fartprincess-d60j3bz.jpg) I shit you not, a series of comic book style panels letting you know that if you steal a woman's purse, you will go to jail. Then there was a wall full of paintings that I really honestly believe may have been painted by 8-year-olds. ![dontworry_by_fartprincess-d60j3k9](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/dontworry_by_fartprincess-d60j3k9.jpg) When I was a little girl, like three or four years old, I had two mottos that I said constantly. The first was the worst thing in the world, "Uh-oh, Spaghettios!" The other were the lyrics to that Bobby McFerrin song. "Don't worry, be happy." Like I said this so much that people prompted me to say it. And now some other kid is living out that same destiny. Life _is_ a challenge. Go get 'em, tiger. ![poem_by_fartprincess-d60j4wg](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/poem_by_fartprincess-d60j4wg.jpg) I like this one because I can actually understand parts of it! Sadly I cannot decipher the handwriting on parts of it, however. ![vangogh_by_fartprincess-d60j56v](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/vangogh_by_fartprincess-d60j56v.jpg) Someone was inspired by Van Gogh. I have more but maybe I'll post it in some sort of graffiti of Zagreb wrap-up later on. 

# Of Parks and Playgrounds

I walked into Bundek Park, which was muddy and rainy. So, in Croatia, or Zagreb, or this part of Zagreb at least, miniature golf exists but not like in America where you have businesses for it with green turf and cool dinosaur statues and colorful putters. Zagreb has a BYOB (Bring Your Own Balls) type mini-golf: ![minigolf_by_fartprincess-d60j5oj](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/minigolf_by_fartprincess-d60j5oj.jpg) I'm guessing someone will pop in and tell me I'm all wrong and this is a weird dream, but I'm trying to imagine someone having mini-golf putters and balls in their home here for the sole purpose of taking to this park. From very far away, I actually thought this was some sort of crudely implemented skate park for toddlers (yeah, you know, I'm retarded, we all get it). All of Bundek Park was really something. I love going to parks and checking out their playgrounds. I may be 28 years old, but you will not keep me away from swings, slides, or anything I can climb. Every country I've been to has is own unique take on playgrounds. I love it. And speaking of things you could climb, this really trumps all:
