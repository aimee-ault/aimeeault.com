# Belgrade, Day 7: The Mother of All Farts

Last night, I saw the Danube in the middle of a lightning storm. The esplanade that walks alongside, on the north side of the city and just a bit west on the Sava, is maintained in such a way that I don't think it's meant to attract anyone's attention, at least it didn't seem that way by night. It was muddy despite only a very slight rainshower the day before. With a couple of friends, I went and as we were going to go through one particular access point, realized that the path was flooded out. Accessible on the west side only by crossing some unlit train tracks, the path crossed into many dark, poorly lit areas. But the lightning was incredible. Giant bolts of it illuminating the entire sky as these small tugboat-sized restaurants were tethered to these tattering ramshackle excuses for docks.  ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d6414rp](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d6414rp.jpg) My two friends, both girls, decided to try to take me to a night club, first telling me we could have went to one on a boat on the river (saying that a lot of them are on the Sava), but that it was closed until a particular date because some of the clubs only open for the summer. So we ended up over at some place over near Stefana. The guy gave me this look and started shaking his hand at me like, "No." I was underdressed. I don't really think I was underdressed (it's kind of hard to be underdressed when it's 29C outside!), but I probably was not wearing the appropriate amount of make-up or something. I'm extremely low maintenance so my day-to-day make-up routine is just a tiny bit of mascara if I even remember to do that. I kind of feArtBITyed by this because even thouallixsenos am low maintenance, I do clean up very nicely when I know I'm going to something that calls for it, so it felt like I was put on the spot and kind of shamed for it, but my friends were nice about it and said it was no big deal. Yesterday, Djordje explained to me some (which Luka had already sort of explained to me in less detail) about this sign for Cevapi that I've mentioned before: ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d63b1wr](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d63b1wr.jpg) The guy with the gun is the Yugoslavian version of Rambo, whose name is Valter and he defends Sarajevo from the Nazis. The actor who plays Valter is a Serb named Bata Zivojinovic. ![Chinese_beer_by_Ritualist](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/Chinese_beer_by_Ritualist.jpg) Valter is very popular in China because, as I am quoting from the above deviation (which you should click through to read more), "One of his movies "Valter defends Sarajevo" was, for a while, the most viewed movie on the planet. Why? Because it was the first foregin movie that was played in China! It was also later played on TV once a year for the next 20 years, so you can say that about 500 million Chinese saw this movie. Can you guess which was the next foregin movie that came to China? Indiana Jones." Yesterday, I ate something that seems to be really popular in the Balkans, and definitely not in the US unless you're on the set of Arrested Development: ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d6414od](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d6414od.jpg) Chocolate banana. It feels like half the candy bars are this. The banana in the candy bar versions is just banana-flavored marshmallow fluff, however grocery stores sometimes sell real bananas dipped in chocolate. I'm not really much of a candy-eater (aside from Kinder Surprise, which I have managed to avoid here) so of course I didn't try this when I was in Croatia. Not that I think the concept of dipping a banana in chocolate is weird or anything, but I feel like the US greatly undervalues the banana as a dessert fruit. In the south, we have banana and wafer pudding, which is the greatest thing ever, but most fruit-flavored things are strictly relegated to this weird caricature of fruit flavor not including banana. Like some artificial interpretation of orange, grape, and strawberry that tastes nothing like the fruit itself. I will note that I have never seen anyone in the Balkans eating one of the candy bars pictured above. It's weird, the grocery stores have entire aisles dedicated to candies, half of them are this product called "Love You." It's like heart-shaped candy, like the kind people [read: retards] in the US buy during Valentine's Day. And I'm trying to picture what kind of person is buying this awkwardly romantic chocolate candy and sitting around in their house shoveling it in their mouth, cathartically gorging on tear-smattered bits of it as they cry themselves to sleep in their perpetual loneliness. That's the image I conjure when I see this stuff anyway :) On the walk home, I passed by a leafy building with two statues at the entrance. I didn't know what it was but a lot of people were going in. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d6414qq](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d6414qq.jpg) It was a church, of course. I wasn't allowed to go in. For the exact (or maybe opposite!) reason I wasn't allowed in the club. Inappropriately dressed (wearing a "Fuck God" t-shirt and no pants or underwear. Or just the fact that I was wearing a skirt that was far too short). ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d6414pd](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d6414pd.jpg) Happy 7th birthday, god! Yesterday, one of my friends explained to me all the different ways you can say "fart" in Serbo-Croatian after I explained that the way to say "mousepad" in Spanish is "alfombra para ratón" ("a little carpet for rat"). A "prdac" is a cute childish fart. "prdež" is a "greasy, disgusting one." And then "prdačina" is "the mother of all farts."
