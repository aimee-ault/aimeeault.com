# Brighton, Day 1

Yesterday was my last day in London. I had originally planned to stay a whole week in London, but changed my mind on that while in Amsterdam. Ordinarily, I thrive in high-energy places. I like being pushed forward with the crowd. I love the breadth of emotion from strangers encircling you in moments and knowing I am a part of it, that I am swimming forward in the stream. But I wanted to go somewhere out of the way. I wanted to experience the effect of culture in a smaller place. So I came to Brighton.  I spent half my day in London, having breakfast at Costa and then visiting the science museum with Dom. At Costa, I had a tea cake. I'm sure there are better places for me to experience tea cakes, but there it was in the little display so I asked for it. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d6ak80c](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d6ak80c.jpg) It tasted like a Munchmallow. I realize that is a very funny thing for me to say. You see, Munchmallows are a product of Serbia. They are snack cake imitations of the real tea cakes popular in the UK. But it was either those or Jaffa Cakes I bought in Croatia that marked my first experience with these confectionery cakes. Mind you, tea cakes are not originally from the UK. They are Danish! But they are popular here and have a light jam filling. I wasn't terribly impressed by the quality of the Costa one, but I guess that's like expecting quality croissants from a Starbucks or something. 

# Bank Cards

When I ordered, the guy working was very addled. In the US, if you pay for something with a bank card using a signed transaction, most businesses have a policy to check the signature on the card itself. Over the years, this has become less and less enforced. My bank card doesn't have my signature on it but I can't think of the last time anyone has asked to see my photo ID to match the name on the card with my identity. However, in England, it seems like there is a lot more at stake legally and so businesses always check to avoid liability. A couple of times I haven't had my ID on me and have been outright denied. At Costa, I signed the receipt and out of habit handed the guy my ID with my card. He looked at the card, and then said, "the signatures don't match." I remarked, "There's no signature on the card to compare it to," but he didn't understand. This got me curious about what I have always blindly accepted as a condition of holding a bank card. What is that signature space really for? Anyone could sign it on your behalf. It's not meant to be used by businesses as an identity verification. It's to mark your acceptance of the contract between you and the issuing bank and many banks will have a policy that businesses should not approve transactions for cards that are not signed regardless of whether or not you can fashion a matching form of identification. Using it for identity verification is merely a useless business process meant to promote a false sense of security. After all, when most people sign receipts, they just sign random scribbles. It's meaningless and it's not something I've thought too much of until seeing a country go heavily overboard with it. 

# Museum of Science

The science museum was cool. The one exhibit I was really interested in, one on the life and times of Alan Turing, I didn't get to see. Some of my favorite things about the museum were the ones no one seemed interested in. There was a bit on this guy who was a pure amnesiac, researched by a behavioral neuroscientist from MIT. This guy, from birth, has been unable to form memories. I don't pay much heed to IQ test scores, but he was thought to be above-average intellectually. However, he was completely dependent on his family and didn't have any friends because... well, his life was like an extended version of that awful Adam Sandler rom-com, 50 First Dates. That's actually an invalid comparison because the guy had no short-term memory, not even minute-to-minute continuity. He had some minor long-term memory, but it was limited... just enough to have the capability of understanding language. When I was in Serbia, I had met a guy and told him about a short story I had wanted to write about a guy who had no capability of developing language and he had suggested maybe going with an angle of amnesia, but now I'm realizing with this very extreme example, that even that may not be a possible approach. But HM, the guy, was cool because he went to ANUS High School :D :D :D ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d6aka76](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d6aka76.jpg) **Who are you?**

> "You are the sum of your experiences: your memory fashions your identity. Each memory you have is held within the changing network of nerve cells in your brain. Sometimes, tragically, you cannot remember. Sometimes the tragedy is that you cannot forget. Science examines the making of memory, and its loss."

The museum covered a lot of research on PTSD. It entered the DSM in the 1980s, but people have talked about it for centuries. We call it shellshock, combat exhaustion, hysteria, soldier's heart, and in Spain, they would even say of a distressed soldier, "est√° roto." (he's broken). People go to war, unprepared mentally for the things they end up seeing, witnessing, feeling. And shockingly, this has a physical impact on the brain, directly affecting the hippocampus. It's amazing that science has given us the ability to see this and use it progressively to help people overcome things. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d6akafa](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d6akafa.jpg)

# Brighton

In Brighton, I have noticed a few things already. First, the flat that I am staying in... it would not surprise me if I learned that a violent crime had taken place here in the past decade. I laugh at this though because I'm not picky about where I stay as long as the Internet is decent and I am close to things I care about. Brighton appears to be very popular with gay and transgendered Brits. It's a seaside town on the south coast. It's about an hour train ride from London. I kind of was a tiny bit aware of the gay community, but not so much the transgender. A few weeks ago, I was watching TV in Sweden, watching a reality TV show popular in America in which two style guides help average people who have been nominated on the show due to heinous crimes of fashion (like wearing baggy sweatpants to their professional office job where they work in PR). The participant I saw was a male to female transgender and she was very concerned with looking like a caricature of a transgendered person. Because that's a real concern within that community, I guess. She didn't want to wear something over-the-top that would give her the appearance of a "drag queen." Here, you see quite a range of different types of transgendered, from people who simply want to fit in and look like anyone else and then people who like the flair. It's cool to sort of be sitting inside of the community and seeing the nuances and social ramifications of it. I was hesitant to even write about this because it's a topic people are often very sensitive about, but I think it's such a huge facet of this town that I'd be doing a disservice to not write about it, even though I have no involvement whatsoever with the LGBT community. They have gender-neutral bathrooms and apparently some official legal title called "Mixter" which is a gender-neutral honorific title to be used in lieu of Mister or Miss.
