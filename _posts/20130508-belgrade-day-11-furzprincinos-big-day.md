# Belgrade, Day 11: Furzprincino's big day!

The other day, a stranger messaged me with some feedback on my journals. It was a rather lengthy and I laughed at it because the letter was addressed to furzprincino... I did a double take and was like, "Did they just translate my dA username into Esperanto??" :D :D :D , but beyond that they had a lot of very fascinating insights and information about the Roma (gypsies) who I have written about in my past couple of entries, and I wanted to share that feedback because it was very eloquently put and politely written in such a way that showed consideration that my mistaken observations are just that, mistakes. And I certainly learned a bit from it: 

> I've been checking [your blog]. And I see this Gypsy thing coming up now and then, and I just have to write to you. What got my frilly knickers in a twist was your friend saying the girls writing that note might be Gypsies because-horrible-grammar. Gypsies put up with a lot of shit in the Balkans, and I'd hate to see the local attitudes rubbing off on you. Over there, Gypsy is not a lifestyle or a subculture, it's an ethnic group. So if you're born Gypsy, you're a Gypsy forever, you can't "get rid of it" by making money and dressing nicer. Based on your facial features or skin colour, most people will be reluctant to give you a decent job, and one in ten will automatically treat you as a thief. If you're a Gypsy girl you might have some leeway to date white boys (as long as your boy can put up with the jokes that will inevitably come their way) but if you're a Gypsy boy you can usually forget about any white girls. When I was a toddler in Bosnia, a common threat from grown-ups was that they'd let the Gypsy woman "steal" you if you don't behave. I think the older people really believed that Gypsies were in the business of baby-snatching. In the day of old Yugoslavia, people from one part of the country would come to another and say "wow, you sure got a lot of Gypsies here" as code for "your city is dirty and dodgy". To this day, Belgraders use "gypsy" as a verb meaning to haggle over trifling gains - a bit like "to jew" in English, but with less respect. I've got more little factoids like that, but you get the picture. I may be making it all out to be very gloomy, and I'm sorry if this looks like I'm just radiating negativity. To be honest, it's been getting better, being a Gypsy has been sucking noticeably less and less with time. But it still sucks, for no good reason, and it pisses me off to think about what those people will be putting up with for decades more to come. So yeah, the truth is that a bunch of them are poorly educated. And typically they don't exactly master the fine standard language. (They natively speak their own (čandes romane?) so they're already being cool about this by universally speaking any Serbian at all.) I'm sure your friend is a nice person and means no harm, but when she sees bad grammar (bullshit BTW*) and suggests then it was likely written by Gypsies, she's just adding another grain to the hill of racism in Serbia which we're supposed to be eroding. And there are so many Serbian teenagers with shitty grammar anyway. *Actually that note is pretty good, there's like one mistaken homophone in the whole text, that's all. It's just that it's plain liquid spoken language, one thought catching up with another, written straight down without trying to make it literature, so on paper a couple of sentences come out technically wrong, like if someone wrote "my friend, you know my friend right, well she was all like whatever…" So… yeah. "Iskulirati" is a funny one, right? By now you've probably gotten the hang of how adding a prefix tends to make a verb perfective. So this one starts from "kulirati" which is obviously from English "cool", on its own something like "to be chilling out" (imperfective). Then when you "cool out" an event or something, you're not getting perturbed or excited about it, or involved very much; your friends may invite you for a night out and you might say "nah, I'll cool it out tonight". Then cooling out a person can mean the same thing, but there's usually more of an implication that you're underreacting, which doesn't have to go as far as ignoring. Like, you ask someone the time of day and they totally ignore you and walk on, they just cooled you out. But if you meet a friend after a long time and go all bursting with happiness and "how are you doing, what's up, damn I missed you so much" and the friend just kind of stands there and says "hi" and gives you a lukewarm hug, they didn't exactly ignore you, but they still cooled you out. There's no way to know what degree of mutual cooling-out happened that fateful night on the Blaywatch. You can cool out both people being assholes and people being nice. The slang in the note is beautiful, though. None of it is extreme or affected, yet it's so far away from the dictionary. I envy you having such a puzzle to disentangle. Have fun!

So that was really cool! (And thank you for the feedback--I am very grateful for it!) I was really happy to get a very in-depth explanation of iskulirati because I wasn't terribly certain what its full context is. As painful as that note was to decipher given its final content, it was indeed a fun puzzle and I ended up learning quite a bit about the language. As for the gypsy/Roma talk, it's a perplexing social conundrum. I want so badly to compare it to racial segregation in pre-1960s America just to have some foothold, but that would be daft of me, I think, even just looking at it from historical implications. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d64igww](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d64igww.jpg) Трг Републике / Trg Republike, a very popular place in Belgrade. It's like "the main square" except Belgrade is big and doesn't really have a main square, so to speak. Statues of horses are a popular place for teens to hang out in the Balkans. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d64igxg](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d64igxg.jpg) Night in Belgrade, near Trg Studentski Yesterday, I went to a cafe in my neighborhood between my dev team's weekly demo call and DreamUp's weekly customer call. I had to have a full conversation in Serbian with the waiter. Before I left, I quickly messaged Luka asking, "Quick, how do you say latte again?" Because in Croatia, any time I tried to order this, I was met with a blank stare. And I don't drink coffee. He said, "bijela kava" but then was like, "Well, in Serbian, bela kava" and I suddenly butted in, "No, it's kafa." And I felt pretty good because I realized the language is sticking on me that I can correct others. Bela kafa is "white coffee." I was able to successfully order that in a cafe on my own and not have to resort to English at any point. It was a small triumph.
