# Belgrade, Day 13: Hulk Hogan Bird

Yesterday, as I was going through Kalemegdan, I noticed a small gate and that a lot of people were walking out of it. Curious, I passed through and discovered Beogradski Zoo vrt, which is apparently running on a donation system and is just a section of Kalemegdan. Knowing that, I figured it would be small and unimpressive but decided to wander through anyway. I don't know why I thought that because both Central Park Zoo and Bronx Zoo are also inside parks and are both very large and awesome, so why would this be any different?  My experiences with zoos in Europe have been varied. I sometimes feel weird talking about zoos when I do visit them because probably more than half the people I'm friends with have this idea that zoos are evil and that animals are truly unhappy in captivity. But to me, zoos are like a lesser of two evils. Many of these animals, as sad as it, cannot survive in their natural habitat anymore--either because that habitat does not exist or because they are in grave danger of poachers. Ideally, they would be kept in nature preserves, but with some of the more exotic animals (and a lot of them are), that's a fight that isn't being won by wildlife conservationists. So zoos, to me, are not pure evil. Dystopian outlook on survival of the fittest? Perhaps. Before I went into the zoo, I saw this dog drinking from a water fountain in the park. It didn't look like a stray and I didn't see any owners nearby, but as soon as I could finish my thought, the dog sprinted off across the park back to its owners, who were probably 70 meters away. And it ran fast. And I thought, "You never see dogs running that quickly. They're always on a leash or sluggishly laying around someone's house." So really my heart is split. Emotionally, zoos make me feel awful. Logically, I know better. Beogradski Zoo was very dirty and seemed to be under heavy amounts of construction, but the animals in it seemed more lively than other zoos. The guys working would often pass by cages and it felt like the animals had familiarity with these guys and were excited to see them, much like a dog gets excited to see its owner after a long day. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d64qh7v](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d64qh7v.jpg) My first moments in the park though were amusing. The very first thing I saw was a woman in a full burka standing in front of a full grown male peacock who had his tail full spread in a mating call. As I got closer, I saw another woman. They weren't there together, but they were both painting. And I thought that was pretty cool. There were birds wandering around everywhere in the paths. Peacocks, chickens, and a few other birds I didn't recognize. ![one_foul_peafowl_by_fartprincess-d64mzsd](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/one_foul_peafowl_by_fartprincess-d64mzsd.jpg) I just like this picture because it has the Belgrade flag in the background. The depressing moment at this zoo came approaching a series of cages tucked in the back where pairs of jaguars and wolves were kept in tiny cages and were found pacing back and forth restlessly. They needed a bigger space, it was obvious, not just some tiny enclave. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d64qh76](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d64qh76.jpg) Tanooki Suit Mario playing that castle level in Super Mario World with the chain link fencing (I hope it pisses off all the Mario World lovers I know that that comment wasn't canon because the tanooki suit was only available in Mario 3 and the chain link fence castle level was indeed Super Mario World. Also, hi, I'm retarded as fuck.) At the leopard exhibit, a guy started talking to me in Serbian, all like, "Šta ti misliš?" And I was kind of hemming and hawing like, "OK"... haha. Funny because you don't really hear people saying "OK" here even though that's a universal word. I just hear people say "u redu." Kind of like Spaniards saying "vale" a lot. He laughed and I laughed and he pointed at the leopards again and repeated the question, thinking maybe I didn't hear him because I had my earbuds in. I sort of paused and was liked, "Ja mislim... oni su dobri?" He laughed and suddenly, in English, said, "Good enough" and I kind of gave this jokingly indignant response and was like, "Wait, did you know I wasn't Serbian?" and he was like, "I heard you singing." We'd end up at some of the same exhibits and he'd tell me the names of the animals in Serbian. None of it stuck except for sova (owl) and ptica (bird). ![hulk_hogan__bird_edition_by_fartprincess-d64n58y](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/hulk_hogan__bird_edition_by_fartprincess-d64n58y.jpg) He looks like the Hulk Hogan of birds. The bird nerd in me liked this zoo though. I had never seen a golden pheasant before in person and now I have. I also saw polar bears having sex (schwinggggg) and a mastiff dog in a cage (???). All the animals in the canine family had cliche doghouses in their exhibits. I thought that was strange. To see a fox emerge from a doghouse. You know, like the kind Snoopy sleeps atop. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d64qh9c](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d64qh9c.jpg) "Ooh yeah gurl, u know u like my cool ice bear boner up in yo pussaaayy. Dayyuuum gurl, how many of dem nipplez you got, 6??" - How I like to imagine polar bears talk dirty (I don't spend much time thinking about this, REALLY) The true gem of the zoo however was not on exhibit. I found a litter of very young orphaned kittens near a janitor's closet. They were not happy to see me, but it was adorable all the same to see a young kitten attempt to hiss. It's funny watching their defense mechanisms when they don't know how to attack or run. Just watching them arch their backs, thinking that's going to scare me off :) ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d64qhql](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d64qhql.jpg) ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d64qhpx](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d64qhpx.jpg) I'm not sure what's worse, the back of this statue when I thought it was a guy peeing into an animal's mouth, or the front of it where it looks like his penis and/or scrotum is a giant tumorous growth that he's jerking off. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d64qhsl](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d64qhsl.jpg) ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d64qhrw](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d64qhrw.jpg) (seriously, where is that water supposed to be coming from!)
