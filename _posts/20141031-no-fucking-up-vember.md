# No-fucking-up-vember

In June, I started a foray into Crossfit. It's been a really wonderful journey into acquiring two tickets to the gun show, but I'm a bit sloppy outside of the gym. I often return from class and eat the first thing I can get my hands on because I'm starving.  Like pizza. Sometimes I forget to eat lunch because I'm busy with work. I think I look great, but I often don't _feel _great. So, for me, November will become "No-fucking-up-vember." **For at least one month, I will attempt to adhere to these rules: **

  1. Drink one gallon of water a day.
  2. No beer or liquor. 1-2 glasses of wine a week max.
  3. 2 cheat meals a week (because it's practical and also because not doing this would be social suicide, I think)
  4. Paleo (modified though, because I eat things like beans and greek yogurt).
  5. No skipping Crossfit days. Unless I am very ill, if I sign up, I go.
  6. 8-9 hours of sleep a night.
  7. 1 Pilates session a week.
  8. Daily fish oil and Vitamin D supplement.
  9. Although I ride my bike about 5-15 miles a day currently, at least one day a week, riding 20+ miles.
I am aware that Thanksgiving occurs in November. But that doesn't really mean anything to me. I've done vegan Thanksgiving before and Paleo Thanksgiving couldn't possibly be weirder than vegan Thanksgiving was. Most of these rules I don't think will be that difficult for me, however I suspect cutting alcohol from my life will be pretty shitty because I love a good ale and whiskey. I enjoy cooking, so I think once I get into the habit of cooking, I'll have an appreciation for it. During this time, I'll be posting weekly updates, including any times I've slipped up, any horror stories, or anything I uncover that is generally very awesome and worth sharing. ![IMG_4542](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/IMG_45421.jpg)

**[aimee](#107 "2014-10-31 12:49:18"):** Ha. That's just my weight-training room. I have Serbian, German, and Greek flags hanging in there but yeah it's pretty sparse, maybe it's time to up my game and hang up all the flags.

**[David](#108 "2014-10-31 19:09:31"):** Is the wine for health (red wine, etc) or calories? Because if it's the latter, the whiskey would probably be better... and if it's the former, hey, dark chocolate too! :D

**[aimee](#109 "2014-10-31 22:03:33"):** The former. Paleo has a lot of weird rules when it comes to alcohol, all about the ingredients it's made from. Since whiskey is made from fermented grain, it's out. Wine, both white and red, is fine (in moderation) because it's made from grapes and its simplicity. Interestingly, a few other liquors can be paleo but none of them are things I like that much: http://www.paleoeffect.com/alcohol-guide/

**[David](#110 "2014-11-01 01:52:14"):** Oh right, Paleo. I wish they'd picked another name for it -- "akin to the diet of humans in the paleolithic era" just makes me want to quibble about what might be possible.
