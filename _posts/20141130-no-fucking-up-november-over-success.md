# No-fucking-up-november Over: Success!

Today is the end of my experiment called "[No-fucking-up-vember](/2014/10/31/no-fucking-up-vember/)." And it was a success! Last Thursday was Thanksgiving and sparing dessert, I stayed full paleo, enjoying turkey, ham, collard greens, cranberry sauce, and sweet potato casserole. I was really happy with how everything turned out--it was way better than Thanksgiving food I've had in the past. I'm going to do a fairly lengthy breakdown in this article, explaining what my take-away was and covering some questions and things that might be helpful to you if you should want to try this experiment for yourself. 

### How I'm Feeling After a Month

_**Great!**_ I lost 5 pounds total, my body fat dropped from 19.4% to 18.1%. My skin feels a tiny bit softer. My skin's appearance... it's hard for me to say if it looks any different. I took a photo every day in the same light... some days it looked better than other days. My immune system seems to be better than ever. While others around me are getting sick with colds and flu, I've been not even slightly ill or even on the verge of illness. I feel happier and less stressed. My concentration is improved. On some days, I have more energy than I have had before. Every now and then, I still have days where I feel kind of sluggish, I won't lie, but those days are a bit more spread out than they used to be. I don't have as much DOMS after intense Crossfit workouts as I used to. I'm posting before and after photos but honestly, I don't think I look much different... my body fluctuates a bit from day to day... and my body was in excellent shape before this experiment. **Before any CrossFit, April 2014 **(a little over 1 month before I started CrossFit--weight around 123 pounds, not sure about body fat or muscle composition but if I had to eyeball it, probably BF 20-20.5% and muscle 32-33%): ![SAMSUNG CSC](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/SAM_2291-682x1024.jpg) **Before experiment, During CrossFit, October 2014** (about 3 weeks before this experiment, weight 124 pounds, body fat between 19.2-19.6% and muscle 34.2%): ![IMG_3985](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/IMG_3985-768x1024.jpg)   (I know people are probably wondering what kind of weird asshole I am standing around in hotel rooms taking muscle flexing mirror selfies... and the answer is: the most_ awesome_ asshole) **November 30th, after experiment (weight 119.5 pounds, BF 18.1%,  Muscle: 34.6%):** ![SAMSUNG CSC](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/SAM_3371-682x1024.jpg) Sadly, I didn't have any penguins to close out my "after" with. Obviously, CrossFit is the biggest contributor to change, but the month of paleo and those other rules, I see more muscle definition on the whole (namely in my quads , a tiny bit in my abs).  In general, I find it unfathomable how people lose enough body fat to get those crazy "six pack" abs that you see on fitness magazine covers. 

### My thoughts on "diets", Paleo, and health before this experiment

It wasn’t obvious to me when I started all of this just how bad my previous diet and lifestyle was. I might have thought, “Oh, I eat plenty of vegetables!” because I had broccoli with my lunch or diced tomatoes played a role in my dinner. It’s also easy to use relative comparison to think you’re doing okay. We all know someone whose diet is _the_ worst, who eats junk and fast food all the time, and it’s easy to think, “My diet is so healthy in comparison to theirs.” It also doesn’t help that our society stigmatizes the word diet and associates it with eating small salads and under-eating. To be concerned with your “diet,” people assume you must have a weight problem or are concerned with short term goals rather than caring about the big picture: your long-term health. I've been pretty skinny my whole life, severely underweight at times even, so no one has ever pressured me to care about my health as much, and so I had no idea just how bad I was. 

### Foods You're Going to Want to Try

  * **[Sweet potato hash](http://paleogrubs.com/sweet-potato-hash-recipe)** \- I made this every Saturday morning, it was that good. It takes a bit of time so it’s not something you’d want to make on a weekday before work, but if you’re not feeding a whole family, you’ll probably have leftovers anyway (or you can double the recipe and definitely have leftovers!). The sausage can easily be subbed with chorizo, turkey sausage, or bacon. Made as is, it feeds 2 people hearty portions with about 2 servings of leftovers.**Pro-tip:** Skip the step to caramelize the onions to save yourself a _lot_ of time. This recipe works just fine if you sauté them with the sausage.
  * **[Curried cauliflower soup](http://paleogrubs.com/curried-cauliflower-soup-recipe) **\- “I’m eating cauliflower? Really? REALLY?” This is a very filling, thick soup. It’s especially great if you have guests or children who are picky eaters because you can very easily play up the flavor with a bit more pepper or add some garlic.

  * **[Roasted red pepper and tomato soup ](http://paleogrubs.com/roasted-red-pepper-soup-recipe)**\- It tastes exactly what it sounds like. Not much effort either. You basically bake ingredients for 35 minutes… then puree them in a food processor and you’re done. As a leftover soup, it turned into a great cold gazpacho that even Barney Gumble wouldn't tell you to go back to Russia over. Served hot, it kind of reminds me of eating tomato soup as a comfort food on a cold winter day.

  * **[Lemon zest poppyseed pancakes**](http://paleogrubs.com/lemon-poppy-seed-pancake-recipe) \- I subbed chia seeds for poppy seeds because who the hell has _poppyseeds_ laying around? Had a sweet lemon flavor to them, not that kind of savory eggy taste that pancakes often have. This also taught me to step up my pancake-making game by no longer committing [all the grievous sins of pancake-making.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/07/pancake-tips-mistakes_n_3677626.html)

  * **[Baked mediterranean chicken**](http://paleogrubs.com/mediterranean-chicken-recipe) \- sundried tomatoes, olives, garlic, and onion? Yase. I don’t normally like eating baked chicken… the texture always seems a bit stringy and flavorless than I want, but this is packed with flavor.

  * **[Home-made cranberry sauce](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10102687954289977)** \- I test ran this a few times, experimented with different ingredients, and turned my kitchen into a science lab to get it just right. Playing with food outside of the context of someone else’s recipe really taught me how to balance flavor. This will make you want to eat cranberries outside of Thanksgiving dinner.

## Comments

**[Joel Meador](#135 "2014-12-01 00:26:38"):** Dat squash soup and cranberry sauce. Nice wrap-up! :) Surprised you didn't mention the new relationship you feel with mac and cheese.

**[Aimee Ault](#136 "2014-12-01 02:06:04"):** I think because it feels weird to say that it's less alluring to me now without having tried pizza which is my bigger vice of the two, haha.
