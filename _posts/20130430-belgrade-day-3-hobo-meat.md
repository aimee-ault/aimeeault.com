# Belgrade, Day 3: Hobo Meat

Yesterday was a fairly tame day for me. I spent most of my day inside writing code and doing work, but I did have to head out for a while because the wireless router that I prematurely celebrated receiving turned out to be a DSL router and the Internet here is not DSL (I'm still saying "thanks" for the router though!).  So I decided I wanted to just get a second Airport Express and be done with it. Not that I have any kind of fangirl-ish support for the A.E., but it's small and I've never had any problems with it, ever, unlike nearly every other router I've ever had. The funny thing about routers is that my experiences with them, when owned by hosts especially, while traveling abroad has been universally negative. Sometimes they just die over the burden of handling too many requests at once. Sometimes there is significant packet loss. Sometimes the ping to the router itself is massively laggy. Unfortunately, there is no Apple store to be found in either Croatia or Serbia. They instead have these "premium reseller" stores that look almost like an Apple store but, well, are not and have a far more limited selection. So I walked over to Novi Beograd to go to UŠĆE. When I was inside the reseller store and didn't see the routers, the guy asked me what I wanted and then pointed at the Time Capsule. I could see it in his face that he knew I wasn't going to be happy with that answer and I was like, "Oh, no, that's... okay." He then did this sort of funny backhand comment where he said, "But if you come back after 5... we'll have the router." It was said in such an unusual fashion that I felt like I was participating in a drug deal. I of course did not have time to come back after 5. The ethernet cable is long so I'm not that limited but having to tether my phone to my laptop to get Internet on that is frustrating. The phone service here seems to be better for international data too. In Croatia, I had this very odd problem where I was connected to VIP HR. The provider is really just a free-for-all. AT&T doesn't really care which I use, but most of the others simply didn't work. VIP would work but would arbitrarily stop working without me knowing. No push notification, nothing. The only way to resolve the problem would be to turn on "airplane mode" and let the phone reset its connection to the cell network. It in so many ways felt like my phone was a shitty router. Here, this has not happened at all, despite the fact that I am connecting to VIP SRB, same provider, different country. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d63kl6r](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d63kl6r.jpg) On my way over to Novi Beograd, I noticed a lot of buildings that looked like they had been war-ravaged. Beograd is unquestionably larger than Zagreb. In Zagreb, I always knew where I was and it was kind of difficult for me to get lost--the city was predictable in layout. Beograd is not as huge as other cities I've lived in, but it is certainly constructed to feel more urban and overwhelming in nature. I may be just saying this because the urban planing in Zagreb was kind of weird to me, which is something many people who lived there made note of to me. Here, the planning resembles any large city. All space is occupied, little parks are kind of sparsely inserted. The playground on the street below is always busy with kids, all hours of the day. There's more traffic, more noise. And, of course, things are open way later. But there are no vast meadows of dandelions to be found. And finding the quaint old historical gems is more difficult. So I'm not saying one is better than the other. They're just very different places, for sure. And it's hard for me to really draw majors comparisons within a couple of days. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d63kl33](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d63kl33.jpg) The Danube runs alongside the city but the city is bisected into Beograd and Novi Beograd by the Sava, which is the same exact river that bisects Zagreb from Novi Zagreb. As I was making this observation, I thought it would be funny if there were a Sad to complement Novi Sad (It's a joke, it would be weird to have a town called Sad, in the same way you wouldn't name some place in the US "Town" or "Plantation"). I think that's the Sava, not the Danube. I don't know if it's the fact that whereas in Zagreb/Novi Zagreb, all the new construction took place in Novi Zagreb and Grad Zagreb was left untouched, but here there is a jarring distinction between new and old. As you can see in the picture above, these boathouses have makeshift bridges leading to them, but they look extremely unstable and rusted. Yet, maybe 200 meters away is a very modern, sleek looking mall. It's in the same evolutionary stylings of Manhattan, I think, only not as quickly evolved or "disneyfied." ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d63kl2m](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d63kl2m.jpg) My Cyrillic is shaky but I think this is "My Beograd!" There's a lot of similarities in national pride between Croatia and Serbia. I'll get more into that as I find more of it. Rather than just giving a one-off example. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d63kl3j](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d63kl3j.jpg) This is the skate park in Novi Beograd. I don't know if there is a bigger one but it takes up a very large part of the map, so I'm assuming this is the skatepark. The difference in letters between Cyrillic and Latin are most obvious here since this translates [almost] directly to English, Skejt Park. The more I recognize words, the easier it becomes for me to read it. At the moment though it's like having to know two languages. I translate from Cyrillic to Serbian and then Serbian to English. But if you just look closely, you can sort of break down words. HOBИ is "Novi", for example. H => N, B => V, И => I. Remembering that P => R, it's not hard to suddenly remember that П => P. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d63kl1y](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d63kl1y.jpg) Baklava! Decorated with the Turkish flag. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d63kl10](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d63kl10.jpg) Pickled broccoli? I didn't try it but maybe I will? Not a thing in the US, really. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d63kkzx](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d63kkzx.jpg) Oh fuck yeah, HOBO MEAT. At last. Nah, it's Cyrillic. New. If you're a new hobo in Serbia does that make you a HOBO HOBO? Derp (I know the answer is "no.") A lot of products in the Balkans seem to have "child" equivalents. In West Europe, this was common with wine, to make a children's alcohol-free version but here it goes for just about anything, including things like tuna:
