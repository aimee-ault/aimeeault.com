# Stockholm, Day 8: Unapologetically Me

The past few days, I've been hard at work writing. Since I've picked up a number of readers since the last time I talked about it, I'll explain some even though most people I know are already well aware of this story. Sometime last fall, I started work on a book that covered my life as a nomad. I had given up my apartment in the US and decided at whim to live in Paris and Barcelona for a few months. I started writing the book intending to give insight on the emotional considerations that went into the decision and how I adjusted to it. It was more a memoir than a travelogue.  But earlier this year, I made the difficult decision to put it on hold for a bit, with the promise to a small handful of people that my sabbatical from it was not permanent. I simply didn't want any turbulence in my life to make an impact on how I ultimately wrote the narrative. As I traveled through Europe this time, a lot of new insight fell on me and I realized that although I wasn't writing the book, to be cliche, the book was writing me. That's to say, I have never stopped thinking about the things I needed to write and my perspective as a writer has often guided how I chose to see things. I thought as the sands of time turned to sediment on the original story, that I would look back on certain things and think, "Man, it seems dumb that I cared about [whatever]." We all want to believe we will grow with age, that time will wise us in ways we're not always looking for, but sometimes we don't get wiser, just older. So I started up writing my book again last week, filling in bits I felt weren't fleshed out well enough and adding a bit more of my own flair to other parts. Writing all that has exhausted me. I felt embarrassed because it made me cry quite a bit. Not because it was sad, not at all. But because much of it was very beautiful and touching to me... feelings that have not changed, even with all the sediment fallen atop. I know for most people reading this, it's just a fun diversion to see photos of the Parthenon and the Colosseum and hear about silly mishaps. For me, it's a lot more than that because none of this is a vacation from my life. It is my life, good days and bad days, and it's such a far cry from a time where I had to fight tooth and nail for everything I ever had. On Friday, an old DeviantArt coworker, Joe Robinson messaged me saying that of all of his friends on Facebook, I have the "coolest life right now." It meant a lot to me coming from someone who gave up everything to hike the full 2,600 mile stretch of the Pacific Coast Trail. It meant a lot to hear coming from someone who I know personally understands that sometimes it's your adventures, even as achey as they can be and tiring at any given moment, that make your life... and know after the fact that you'll be a richer person for it long after the fatigue has worn off. So I'm excited for my book to be coming together finally. I'm excited to share it with the world. Because I finally feel that it is 100% unapolegtically me. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d699ran](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d699ran.jpg) ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d699rc1](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d699rc1.jpg) ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d699rf0](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d699rf0.jpg)
