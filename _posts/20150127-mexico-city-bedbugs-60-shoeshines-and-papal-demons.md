# Mexico City: Bedbugs, $60 Shoeshines, and Papal Demons

In fall 2013, I briefly lived in Mexico City for about a month and a half. I never got the chance to write about it, mostly because I was too busy and it felt like every moment I was about to have the opportunity to sit and write, some new, odd, and unusual thing was happening. ![15231677986_143e19fe4e_k_by_fartprincess-d8cq28x](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/15231677986_143e19fe4e_k_by_fartprincess-d8cq28x.jpg) I was in New York City when I made the decision to go. Why Mexico, I'm not really sure. I had no home. No plans. And I had a matter of days to figure out where I was going next. Where I end up is often arbitrary and decided on a roulette of whim. Sometimes, it's answering to the question of "where I will get the most of my money?". Other times, it's "where will I live most authentically and not constantly be engaging with and having my feet stepped on by other Americans?" Typically the answer to both of these questions are the same types of places. So I simply figured Mexico, namely Mexico D.F., was worth a shot and found a guy who was in Amsterdam at the time, subletting his top floor apartment in a neighborhood (or colonia, as they are called there) called Roma Norte for a scandalously low price. Unlike other adventures I've embarked on, I was feeling jaded at the time. I was superficially excited, but I was in a dark place on the inside, feeling no more like a nomad... but more like a drifting vagrant on the run. I wasn't without action or decisiveness, but I didn't feel like anything I did mattered. ![15068154107_d86709d545_k_by_fartprincess-d8cq2mk](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/15068154107_d86709d545_k_by_fartprincess-d8cq2mk.jpg) The night of my trip, my first flight was delayed and I ended up arriving at LAX 2 hours after my flight departed, at 2AM, rescheduling my flight into Benito Juarez on a 7AM flight. I waived the opportunity to get a free hotel room and slept on the floor using my backpack as a makeshift pillow. A cleaning lady continuously bumped my backpack with a vacuum cleaner. This made me feel exceptionally homeless. I was working for DeviantART at the time. And I was notoriously known for 30,000 feet deploys and commits from weird IP addresses in other countries, but I didn't say anything at the time to anyone. I wanted to disappear. I was tired of the identity I had created for myself by negation. I'm the kind of person who doesn't own things. I'm the kind of person who never wants for anything. I'm the kind of person who always bucks tradition. And, you know, when you are all of these things, or none of them rather, people lose all ability to relate to you except through the lens of voyeurism and vicariousness. Maybe not all who wander are lost, but sometimes those who wander are misguided gypsies. When I first arrived into Mexico City, it was mid-afternoon and the taxi driver dumped me off at the corner of Calle Chihuahua and Avenida Frontera (as a side-note, I never did figure out what Frontera, which translates to "border", was actually supposed to be a border to, because the eastern border of the Roma neighborhood was actually one street over on Cuauht√©moc). Given that Teseo, the guy who owned the apartment, was out of the country, I needed to call the building's super to get in. This was an old lady named Nati, who spoke no English and was perhaps the sweetest little old lady I have ever met. For perspective, Nati lived in the building's garage and spent her days parking cars and mopping the stairwell with turpentine and flannel sheets. Despite her meager living, every morning when I ran down the stairs, she was there to greet me with a polite smile and a calm "buenas." My first meeting with Nati was one of confusion and near-panic and within moments, turned all of the gloom and funk hanging over me into a surreal awareness that... well, when shit goes all wrong, sometimes it's pretty fucking funny. And that's what my life in Mexico was. Things were constantly going haywire in the worst way possible, but even as I was living it, man it was a riot. And so, I will share, now, all these horrible stories. 

## "Bedbugs"

My penthouse was great. From the front door of the building to the inside of my apartment, there were 5 separate locks with 5 individual keys. There was an initial door that entered into a very tiny atrium leading to a second door which led to my terrace. Far inside the terrace was the glass door entrance to the apartment's interior. The penthouse was, inside, fairly averaged sized (maybe 400-500sqft?), but its terrace was 800sqft and had an impressive view of the central historic district with both sunset and sunrise views. ![15067940269_0bab782aac_k_by_fartprincess-d8cvmnj](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/15067940269_0bab782aac_k_by_fartprincess-d8cvmnj.jpg) Inside, although decorated quite fascinatingly, there was something left to be desired. It was dirty and despite frequent attempts to resolve this with Nati, the water heater was broken. Fortunately my gym down the street, which I went to daily, had hot water. ![15254329662_85b6b80ac7_k_by_fartprincess-d8cvmtf](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/15254329662_85b6b80ac7_k_by_fartprincess-d8cvmtf.jpg) ![15068171788_7cdbced626_k_by_fartprincess-d8cvmtp](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/15068171788_7cdbced626_k_by_fartprincess-d8cvmtp-768x1024.jpg) The weather was hot, and I often slept with the front door to the terrace open. About a week in, I found myself waking up in the middle of the night to bites. I wasn't sure what was causing the bites. They were too small to be mosquito bites, I was sure. Ant bites? Maybe. Stinging flies? Possibly. Maybe it was the open door. I closed it one night, but still, there I was once more waking to weird track marks down my arms and legs. Parts of my body that were buried under the sheets also victim. I wasn't sure what to say, but all signs were pointing at bedbugs. ![15068167988_30537c695a_k_by_fartprincess-d8curo4](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/15068167988_30537c695a_k_by_fartprincess-d8curo4.jpg) I had already invited my boyfriend, Joel, who I had just recently started dating less than a month before, to come visit... and was horrified of the thought of him being exposed. For me, it wouldn't have been a huge deal. I had no home. But he did. I wasn't sure what to say to him. We had only just had the "is this a relationship" talk and I didn't know what the protocol was for having the "do you want to share my insect infestation" talk. I also didn't want to say anything to Nati or Teseo without knowing for sure. A cleaning lady, Vicki, came by once a week, but I found communicating with her difficult. We never seemed to be in the apartment at the same time. And she often left notes for me asking if she could take the leftover bread and any uneaten food I had in my fridge. Her letters were filled with spelling errors that are relatively confusing for someone who doesn't speak the language natively.

**[Garrett](#143 "2015-01-28 14:13:27"):** Good stuff Aimee. I am glad there are people out there like you that I can live vicariously through.

**[Tyler](#144 "2015-02-03 02:35:43"):** I'm a huge fan of your blog, Aimee. You've got a way with description, and an optimism that makes me wish you wrote more often.

**[Joel Meador](#145 "2015-02-24 20:33:53"):** Can confirm that the bus situation to the pyramids was the most surreal travel experience I've had. You know, once it sunk in *why* they were taking names and face pictures.
