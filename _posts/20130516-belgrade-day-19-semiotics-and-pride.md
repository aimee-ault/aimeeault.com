# Belgrade, Day 19: Semiotics and Pride

Before I begin, I just want to put it out there that my Internet connection here in Serbia makes me want to strangle someone. It's slow! So slow! My boss, Sasha, jokingly asked if the entire country was on a shared T1 line. I remarked back, "more like a shared ISDN line." But I was only half-joking because it really feels like that sometimes. Close runners up for slow Internet? Our dev team's Breadlands offsite in Les Sauvages, France and pretty much anywhere in Cuzco, Perú. I don't even click on half the links people send me. I'm sorry. I want nothing more than to watch YouTube videos, watch Netflix over VPN, and play a nice long round of Team Fortress 2, but that shit is just not happening.  Last night I went to Carabić for dinner. Foursquare claims it is "popular with pizza connoisseurs" and it had a 9.3 rating. 2 slices of domacinska ordered, which was like sauce, goat cheese, and prosciutto. Carabić's box says "Since 1992" but the website claims it's the oldest pizzeria in Novi Sad. So I don't know if it was just late getting to Beograd or if pizza just did not exist in Serbia until the '90s :D I'll assume the former! But when the woman finished the order, she leaned in and asked me, "Do you want something on the pizza? Perhaps some ketchup?" I swear I could hear everyone in Croatia letting out a collective scream of horror as I ordered Luka's _favorite_ pizza, ketchup. The time I got ketchup on pizza in Zagreb, it came separate and it felt different. This was just lovingly splashed on from a squirt bottle. I couldn't really taste it. I just tasted the cheese and meat. Everyone else there had ketchup on their pizza. I even saw some girl getting mayonaise on her pizza. I don't get the impression that Carabić is supposed to be high-class or anything. It's just a popular place. And the pizza is neither cheap nor expensive, just middle-of-the-road in comparison to other places (100 Dinar a slice, so about $1 USD for a slice) ![2013_05_15_20_08_35_2_by_fartprincess-d65g6eq](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/2013_05_15_20_08_35_2_by_fartprincess-d65g6eq.jpg) Anyway. I made it to Topćider today on my own, but not before passing through Hajd Park. Get it? It's Hyde Park. But it's nothing like Hyde Park. It's a nice quiet, fair-sized park full of nature trails. These trails reminded me of being in the US. The smell of trees carried a heavy smell of the woods in America. ![2013_05_16_11_04_31_2_by_fartprincess-d65g6j7](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/2013_05_16_11_04_31_2_by_fartprincess-d65g6j7.jpg) Outside of the park was this weird as fuck wall of wailing heads. I don't know the significance. But I found it kind of intriguing. ![2013_05_16_11_11_48_by_fartprincess-d65g70x](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/2013_05_16_11_11_48_by_fartprincess-d65g70x.jpg) Hajd was just kind of this empty place you might go to collect your thoughts as you jogged. No wildlife. Loosely scattered picnic tables here and there, but mostly just long stretches of flat dirt trail in the midst of a canopy of shade-bearing trees. Nothing to see but nothing to regret. Topćider was a bit different. It was not busy, definitely nothing like Kalemegdan at night (which will have hundreds if not thousands of people in it) but it was more planned out. There's a lot to say about a park based on who is in it. This was just a class of school children amongst a few tired old men napping on benches. It's hard for me to say if these men are homeless. In America, it is common for homeless people to sleep on benches in parks. But I'm not inside the culture enough to evaluate people's appearances in conjunction with their socioeconomic status. I mean, obviously I think if I saw a well-groomed guy my own age wearing brand name clothing, I wouldn't mistake him for a homeless person, but beyond that, no, I can't tell the difference. ![sleepingbeauty_by_fartprincess-d65gc02](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/sleepingbeauty_by_fartprincess-d65gc02.jpg) But anyway, this park had some "features." ![2013_05_16_11_35_07_by_fartprincess-d65g76u](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/2013_05_16_11_35_07_by_fartprincess-d65g76u.jpg) This park is inside of a valley. It has historical significance because it's where the prince lived (as you can see in the top right of the map above) part of the year, but it was also where war artillery was kept to defend Serbia against the Ottoman Empire. There is a small creek that passes through it (I don't think it's a river, it's way too small) and people like to hang out next to it and have picnics or whatever. The sycamore tree in the center of the map is historical too because it was planted 180 years ago by the prince. That's all there is to that story that I know (I'm sure there's more, I just haven't looked it up). So the lesson learned here is that you should plant a tree because if you ever get famous, no one will ever cut it down. ![2013_05_16_11_40_39_2_by_fartprincess-d65g7e5](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/2013_05_16_11_40_39_2_by_fartprincess-d65g7e5.jpg) I don't know what this means. I tried translating it, but I wasn't having much luck. I feel funny knowing that I am sort of lost in a sea o red, white, and blue in the Balkans, the same colors my own country identifies itself with. The colors are everywhere. In clothing. In building design. In street art. In everything. And it made me think. Once upon a time, I hated on my own "home" country. We're dumb, we're wasteful, we're evil, and patriotism is corny as fuck. But here's the thing. All countries have their bad and if you persistently have a bad impression of your own country, you are only contributing to what makes it bad. The pageantry is cheesy, yes, but it's part of the culture. It's awesome that someone would give me a double thumbs up for wearing a Serbian armband. Although I am not "homesick," I do kind of have a nicer view of some of the US's historical icons, monuments, colors, and so on.
