# Belgrade, Day 2: Bleed It Out

I started thinking yesterday morning about stuff I really want to do in Belgrade. Not places I want to see or anything like that, but just general personal "goals" for my time here.  I want to cook more while staying here. I have a full kitchen to use all to myself. I love to cook but I've always been prone to cooking vegetarian or vegan meals. I'm in the meat capital of the world, so I figure there is no time like the present to learn how to cook well with meat :) I want to do weightlifting. It's been a month since I left my gym in Austin. I want to do squats and deadlifts badly. I figure in a country where everyone seems to be in good shape, I can probably accomplish this. Maybe get a few awkward stares, but what's new there? I used to be a part of an online group of women around my age who were into olympic lifting. A few of them lived in places like Hong Kong and claimed that they were denied the right to lift in some gyms on the claim that they would get "bulky." I really kind of wish this weird misinformation would stop getting passed around. I've been lifting off and on for 5 years now and I'm one of the smallest women I know. I want to write more code. I need a nice, clean, quiet environment for that. And I have it. I'd love to see DreamUp grow and thrive more and I'd love to see my own personal projects take off. Basically, to thrive, I need solitude contained with bustling energy. Belgrade seems to be just that. It's loud and noisy outside and I can feel the swelling pressure of bodies and cars moving on the street below but it is sunny and quiet in here. The mornings here are not without loud diesel-y rumbles of car engines, honking, construction, and kids yelling. I like it. I want to start playing piano again. I played when I was younger. Then, like most people, I stopped. I have a piano in my bedroom and that's pretty awesome. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d63gdnd](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d63gdnd.jpg) ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d63gdlv](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d63gdlv.jpg) I also now have a wireless router, thanks to Robert (I didn't get to thank you last night, so: THANKS!) :) 

# First Full Day in Belgrade

I went to PHP Day in Belgrade. It was much, much larger than the one I went to in Zagreb. The Zagreb one had a turnout of maybe 15 people. I couldn't count how many people were at this one, but it was well over 200, enough that I had random strangers stopping to make conversation with me prior to the event, which was really cool. I couldn't understand any of the talks given. It was funny because I'd say about half of them had slides in English despite the talk being given in Serbian. After the event, Luka was asking me if I was "noticing the difference between Crotian and Serbian." I felt silly because I didn't. It sounded the same to me. From what I can understand, the differences between the two languages are not hugely noticeable if you don't speak either fluently. Given that I have been trying to pick up Croatian as much as I could by way of immersion, my brain was more searching for similarities than differences. And I of course noticed tons of similarities. There's dialectic tension produced by the fact that the language is split on political strife, surely, but for me, it's like I'm a 3-year-old seeing words I recognize and feeling ecstatic for knowing them. Last night I recognized the word "petak" on a sign and was happy that I even knew it was a day of the week, not sure if it was Thursday or Friday, but definitely knew it was one of the two. I then realized I knew the days of the week and the months in Croatian and was really thrilled to feel my knowledge of something being applied. 

# Groceries and Money

I went to get groceries before PHP Day. I was pleasantly surprised by the cost of groceries here. I had a short list of things I needed to get, including liquid laundry detergent. I was keeping a tab on my phone's calculator, counting up the Dinar because I'm not used to the currency yet. I ended up buying a package of gnocchi, 2 drinks, 1 liter of milk, 1 box of cereal, and 2 large croissants for about 1100 Dinar. This is roughly $11 USD. In the US, this purchase would probably cost you around $25-30 and the liquid laundry detergent alone would be around $10. The cost of living here seems very, very low all around. I didn't really buy groceries in Croatia but the pricing, although lower than US certainly, wasn't that skewed. It is a little strange because many of the stores here do not want to take "large" bills (large being a 1,000 Dinar bill... roughly $10 USD). I understand why not because a gigantic 2 liter bottle of water cost me 50 Dinar... that's 50 cents. In the US, this would run you maybe $2-3. And here that purchase breaks down into a lot of change. Surprisingly, they do have coins here. I don't think they are very common though. Luka did give me his 5 Dinar coin that he got back on something. There used to be para coins (cents) but they're no longer in circulation. 50 para was the most recent. For perspective this is 1/2 of 1 US cent. A fraction of a penny. Before I left Zagreb, I went geocaching and left a US dime in one of the geocaches. One of the friends I made in Zagreb pointed out to me that the dime does not actually give any indication of its value. I have never in my 28 years in the US noticed this. It doesn't though. I don't currently have any US coins in my possession but if I'm remembering correctly, none of the other coins have their value stated on them either. The dime has language indicating what it is (it literally says "dime" on it), but I'm not sure if the other coins follow suit. Because I am planning on doing actual cooking here, my perceptions of the grocery store are suddenly different. I'm looking at meats and vegetables and paying attention to what ingredients I might be cooking with. I don't have any totally awesome recipes to try out yet but I'm open to any if anyone wants to share. I'm also in love with the variety of juice here. In the corner store down the street from my apartment, they have a full wall of juices. Sour cherry. Blackberry. Raspberry. Mango. I thought the juices in Croatia were pretty good, but there was less variety. It was mostly apple, pear, orange, and peach (along with "multivitamin", which is what they call "tropical punch" in this part of the world--it looks like in Serbia they might actually call that "koktel" [cocktail]). I'm not sure which makes me laugh more, because I'm pretty sure a single-fruit juice has most of the same vitamins as a blend... they are fruits after all, and a cocktail is usually alcoholic. Its second definition is non-alcoholic but has negative connotations. I am saying this from the vantage point of an English speaker. I realize meaning sometimes does not transcend language :) ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d63gd9n](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d63gd9n.jpg)

# Logos and Branding and Language

I noticed that many of the grocery stores here have this logo of a lion. The lion is identical to the logo for Food Lion, a grocery store chain in the southeastern part of the United States.
