# Zagreb, Day 31: Dilettante

Last night I had my first tram misadventure. The tram, for those who don't know, is not really a tram in the sense that most Americans know it (I associate the word with a San Francisco-style trolley). It's more of an above-ground light rail, almost identical to Portland's MAX. Given that it is above ground, I think their public transportation is actually very well designed. People in the US rave maniacally abou Portland being the best public transport in America, but I immediately rescinded that sentiment when I visited Europe the first time and saw how expansive the Parisian Metro was and how frequent the Barcelona Metro ran (A train every 5 minutes? Yes please.)  Zagreb's tram system is not as fantastic as those two cities' but I understand it's just a matter of expectations per population size. For the city's size, it goes above and beyond. Similar to Portland, Zagreb does not enforce fare consistently. People often ride the tram (illegally) for free. I can understand this because it seems like anyone routinely commuting via tram would be unable to afford it. I can't remember what the average salary is here, but it's definitely not in line with the cost of transportation for daily tram rides. Last night, I was invited to go to a game night with some friends here. It was at the house of this guy Saša, who lives far, far east of Zagreb, way past Maksimir Park. I'm sure people who live here are scoffing at me saying "far east," but for me, all the way over by Arena without a car, that's far. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d62llg0](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d62llg0.jpg) To start the misadventure, I walked to Savski Most and thought I got on the wrong tram. There are a few trams that run through Savski Most: 4, 14, 7, and 17 are the ones I know immediately. I was confused however because I thought I had gotten on the 7 going the wrong direction (as it turns out, the 7 only goes ONE direction there). I was actually going in the right direction but seeing that it was heading towards Savski Gaj and then the stop past that, I immediately got off and was thinking I needed to head back. Derp. I ended up heading back on the 14, getting off, getting on the 4, which is a straight run. While waiting for the 4, I started to notice the casino signs. I took this photo probably my second day here but not until recently have I really thought about what gets to me about it: ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d62mjlm](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d62mjlm.jpg) Christopher Columbus, settler of the "New World" posed in front of a slot machine for a casino, which back in the US, is one of the only ways native American tribes continue to gain revenue... given that throughout the colonization of America, natives have been robbed time and time again of all their precious land. So, thanks Croatian casino for making that weird commentary a reality. 

> Columbus sailed the ocean blue back in 1492. And once the 7th day elapsed, he played a thrilling game of craps.

Is that how the poem goes? However, while sitting on the 4, I had this gut reaction to turn and look back to the front of the tram. A woman was passing through, checking fare. I'm told the fare inspectors don't work frequently and definitely not on Sundays, but here we were. I wasn't really concerned or anything, because I'm not from here and I could always play dumb and just get kicked off. I picked up my things and walked towards the far back izlaz, standing there impatiently waiting for the next stop. I figured seeing someone walk to a far exit would be a dead giveaway that they were trying to evade fare, but the woman continued to act nonchalant. Seeing me standing at the exit so prematurely, other (younger) riders started to notice the inspector and suddenly there were maybe 10 people trying to get off all at once, giggling and squirming. When I went to unload from the tram, the fare inspector sort of grabbed me for a second and got very pushy with me, insisting I get off. At this point, I fluffed my feathers, jutted my chest out, and screamed in the most intimidating fashion, "What! What! You want a piece of this, bitch?" as I bumped my torso against her rickety leather skin bag of bones and launched into a deadly game of fisticuffs. That part didn't really happen. Unlike the other people who were getting off, who probably couldn't afford the 300 Kuna fine, I was entirely breezy about it. I had no ID on me. I don't live here. I figured there wasn't much they could do other than tell me what a naughty girl I am. At this point, although I knew exactly where I was, I didn't know how the trams routed. This was near the main train station where the rails start to go crazy and diverge. At this figurative "fork in the road," I decided to go left because that seemed to be the most sensible and logical approach, given that my destination was north. But the tram stops were numbered for other lines instead and I thought, "Well fuck, okay." I thought, "Well if I can make it to Ilica, I'll be fine because I know 4 runs to Maksimir." (**pro-tip:** I'm your go-to girl if you want someone who can calmly guide you stress-free out of a disaster. I always keep my cool.) As I walked up Ilica, the 4 passed me. "Well fuck, okay." I jogged, hoping to catch it at the next stop but I couldn't find the next stop. There was a bunch of construction going on east of the city center and the stops had been moved and placed with these temporary, easy-to-miss signs. At this point, I'm an hour late for game night. But I'm messaging Saša explaining the situation, he's in good spirits about it, so I figure, "I've come this far, I'll make it." I finally catch the 4. It is so packed that I'm not even sure if I can fit inside, but I try to squirm myself in like a long straight Tetris piece, expecting all of us in the tram to evaporate as I wedge in. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d62llfu](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d62llfu.jpg) Only once there, did I realize that Saša's house had exploded into a turnip-shaped rainbow. I did finally make it there. Game night was fun. We played Arkham Horror, which is like some D&D type board game. I had two characters to choose from, a dilettante and an archeologist. I don't know why I picked the dilettante, because the archeologist was bad-ass and had this cool Inigo Montoya Princess Bride story about his father's murder haunting his nightmares. The game is supposed to last 2-4 hours. There is a monster that you are trying to keep from waking up. You close portals to do this. Somehow, we ended up "beating" the game (I guess that's the way to say it because it's a coop board game) in under an hour and spent the rest of the evening just hanging out and talking. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d62llns](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d62llns.jpg) ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d62llmq](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d62llmq.jpg)
