# Zagreb, Day 21: Je Te Plumerai La Tete (Bird Fight)

Today I bought socks. They're made for children, yet they fit me. They say "Proud to be Croat" on them. I am not a Croat, but I am a lover of socks, so if I had to walk away from Croatia with one "souvenir," I managed to find the perfect thing for myself.  I had to return my bike. I am amazed at my complete incapability of getting lost in Zagreb. I rarely consult maps. I just have this very fine-tuned internal compass. I know that Mednevica is always due north. And I'm really good at navigating with the aid of the sun's position thanks to all the time wasted on sundials in my youth. Once I was finished returning the bike, I had a weird aggressive feeling against walking. It suddenly felt slow and inefficient and I wished I had the bike still. I'm writing this a bit early today because I'm going somewhere this evening and probably won't have time to write when I get back. I figured earlier, "Okay I'm on the north-east side of Zagreb, what can I do?" I stopped into Konzum and got some burek. As I was sitting outside at a table, an older man came and joined me. It was like... 11AM. But he was drinking beer. I felt sort of awkward about it. For reference, the only people that publicly drink beer at 11AM are bums in the US. However, the US has less of a drinking culture than east European countries do. I mean, we have a drinking culture that is condensed into "college" but aside from that, once you're out of college, you're supposed to have your shit together and all the fruits of your academia are supposed to take you somewhere that is not conducive to manic episodes of binge drinking. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d61fow3](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d61fow3.jpg) After this, I made my way up towards Maksimir. I figured I may as well check out the zoo. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d61fove](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d61fove.jpg) ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d61foum](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d61foum.jpg) There is a wall that runs near Pimpek Plac that is like... children's artwork. Nothing particularly fancy. I'd gauge that the artists are between 6 and 10 years old. It's mostly things like kids painting animals and houses and seasons changing. I will say that it's strange to me that someone can take the work of an innocent kid and turn it into a brash political statement: ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d61fotp](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d61fotp.jpg) For anyone needing a history lesson, NATO [North Atlantic Trade Organization] staged some of the first military interventions in Bosnia in the early 90s--and enforced Operation Deny Flight which turned central Bosnia and Herzegovina into a no-fly zone. That's really just the tip of the iceberg. I'm sure anyone who lives here could give a much more thorough history. All I remember is what I saw on late-night CNN's 24-hour news broadcasting coverage of the war when I was maybe 7 years old. Croatia is a member of NATO, but only very recently (like sometime in the last 5 years). ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d61fosf](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d61fosf.jpg) Zebra cross-walk :) This was featured in some imgur image going around the web and people were saying it was fake. It's not. It's in Zagreb. I don't know why anyone would think something so trivial would be fake. The zoo admission was cheap. Everything in Zagreb is cheap. 30 Kuna for a somewhat large zoo. That's about $5 USD. They are also very lax here about enforcing admission fees and such. You could easily sneak into the zoo or any museum here if you really wanted. When I asked Luka "What's keeping me from stealing this bike? They don't have my passport number or anything." He replied, "YES. Starting to think like a local. Assimilation complete." I just laughed, but it's really, really easy here to weasel your way around stuff. In comparison, America is very vigilant and distrustful (surprise!) The first animal in the zoo decided it wanted to attack me. And it really, really tried. It started bashing its beak into the glass window trying to bite me. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d61forp](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d61forp.jpg) I was actually a little concerned that my immediate reaction was laughter rather than being a little startled. I recorded a video but it doesn't look like it's "attacking" in the video as much as it just looks like it's dancing with me. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d61foqx](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d61foqx.jpg) ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d61foq3](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d61foq3.jpg) Snowy owls are awesome. Always laughing or smiling. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d61foow](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d61foow.jpg) A carnivorous plant. So, I noticed that the animal selection of Zagreb's zoo is much different from what I have seen in other zoos, even other European zoos. In some way, it feels like Zagreb got shafted on all the "awesome" animals that everyone wants to see, but at the same time, it has a lot of animals I've never seen before, so that's kind of awesome. Oddly, it had a ton of plants though that were... amazingly... indigenous and only found where I grew up, in South Carolina. I recognized them immediately. I haven't seen any of them since I left the south. I feel a little wistful when I see things like that because they remind me of being a kid again, but not so much that I would ever want to go back :) ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d61foo1](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d61foo1.jpg) I take photos of danger/caution signs wherever I go. I love that outside of the US, all skulls on these signs are always smiling. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d61fonk](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d61fonk.jpg) Sup!
