# Zagreb, Day 22: The Vast Sands of Texas

So, at Luka's recommendation, I downloaded this iPhone app which tracks everywhere you go without you doing anything. It has an Orwellian vibe to it, but it doesn't share the data anywhere publicly (well, until I share it myself). I was curious to see how much I was walking here each day.  ![myday_by_fartprincess-d61lucs](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/myday_by_fartprincess-d61lucs.jpg) And there you have it. I went out last night with some people to this music practice hall called MD Partner Vje≈æbaonica near Cibona Toranj. I was told there would be "free beans." I have never been excited at the prospect of beans, nor was I here. Not that I dislike beans. They're a fantastic source of fiber. But it's not something that has any sort of culinary renown so I was curious to see why anyone would get all up in arms over them (especially so much that I'd have to show up early). 

# Socio-Economic Differences

I've hung out with a few people here. I'm starting to notice a rather extreme difference between people on socio-economic levels. Namely between "students" and the working class. It's hard for me to write about this without any bias, so I apologize if anything I say comes off as misguided or maybe even rude. Keep in mind that it is purely how I see it as an American. In the US, it's common, expected even, for students to work, even in high school. We're expected to take shitty service jobs after school. We're expected to work to some extent through college as well. For example, when I was a senior in high school, I worked at a toy store. The pay was minimum wage ($5.15/hour in South Carolina--which I believe was also the federal minimum wage). However, in college, I worked as a software engineer. I had to... I was financially independent from my family and had rent and bills to pay. But here, students don't work usually. Companies give the service jobs to fulltime employees. So students here are legitimately poor and often rely on their families. As a result, there is this huge difference between quality of living for "younger" and "older" groups. I can't judge either group too much, because I've been poor before and I will always remember what it was like, when I was 21, to literally have to sit on the floor of my kitchen, counting coins out of a pickle jar because I didn't have enough money to pay rent that month. The difference in wealth distribution here may be more noticeable to me because I'm an outsider and the characteristics are different here. 

# Texas

So last night, I was getting asked a lot of questions about Texas. When people ask where I am from, I'm not really sure what to say. I don't have a place I really feel like I am "from." My residency is in Texas. I lived in Portland before that but not for long enough to feel like I have any sense of belonging there. And I grew up in South Carolina but I left there in such a Harry Houdini escape act, that I don't feel like I understand that part of the country anymore and have a hard time representing it or speaking for it. When I tell people I'm from Texas, the first question they ask me is if I own a gun. Every single person asks this in the most austere, straight-faced manner. To humor them, I let them know that I have indeed fired a gun before and that I support gun ownership rights and the second amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Last night, someone asked me if there was "a lot of sand" in Texas. I was really confused. "You mean like... by a beach? Huh?" "Because there is desert." "I... that's... no... what?" I thought it was funny that someone would have the knowledge of Texas having desert (it does) but equate "desert" with the image of an African desert with sand dunes. So I tried to playfully divert from the fact by saying, "Well there is tumbleweed!" Because even that surprised me when I got to Austin... tumbleweed just rolling down the street on a chilly Christmas morning. 

# Language

I've been thinking a lot about why people get so uncomfortable speaking English around me. I'm a very forgiving person with language gaffes. The other day, a woman said "fifty" to me when she meant to say "fifteen." I smiled and kindly (and loudly) clarified, "I'm sorry, I didn't hear you. Did you say fif-TY or fif-TEEN?" And let her work out the right word on her own. She seemed to give me a sheepish look when she recognized her mistake but I just sort of quietly smiled and let the moment pass as if nothing had happened. A lot of people will say they want to improve their English or that they would love to talk to a native speaker, but then when it comes down to it, they back away from me. I had a conversation the other night about this with a woman here and she told me, "It's not you. It's them," and confirmed that it was indeed an embarrassment issue, a fear of looking stupid. And I said to her, "I don't get it. I'm not judgmental." And she said to me again, "It's not you. It's them." But, as much as I can't on principle understand it, I see the roots of it now. When I make a mistake with Croatian, I sometimes feel like people are very rude about it and treat it like it were the end of the world. It doesn't stop me from clarifying and making sure I understand, but the attitude is, "How could you be so stupid?" Today, I was ordering a waffle and accidentally asked the woman to put "cinel" on it, which is apparently a word for "cymbal[s?]". I meant to say "cimet" (cinnamon). But her reaction wasn't laughter or a smile or a correction. It was just a really blank stare. I started digging around in my head, trying to think of what I had done wrong. I wasn't sure if I had made a language mistake or if I had maybe violated some sort of Croatian etiquette or if I had just totally fucked up and somehow killed a family of deer on my way into the restaurant. It was impossible to tell by her reaction and she wasn't saying anything! I at this point will try to apologize, explain, "I'm sorry, I don't speak Croatian. Maybe I said something wrong?" and see if we can establish what the miscommunication or faux pas was. But you know... language isn't a burden. It's a funny thing. It's something that has evolved with us and should be treated with humor and affection. If I make a mistake, I promise your day will not end. It's a learning opportunity for me. The embarrassment makes the lesson much more memorable. Likewise, if someone makes a mistake with me, I try to make the correction memorable by finding a way to incorporate a lesson in etymology if I know a little bit about the origins of the word. I find doing that often helps people get a broader understanding of why the word is what it is. Or barring that, I try to make it into a joke if I can find a way. For example, a friend today was explaining sarma to me by saying it was "minced meat wrapped in cold slaw," and then asked, "Is it slaw or slav?" I said, "It's slaw... unless you're telling me you killed someone :)" 

# "Uptown"

I've been up to the northern part of Grad Zagreb before but usually on rainy, rainy days. That part of town largely has lost my interest because it's overwhelmed by churches and religious icons. For example, Saint Mark's Church: ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d61m81c](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d61m81c.jpg) Which is really famous because it's old. It dates back to the 13th century. And the roof is obviously something. I like the roof because it looks like it was made with Legos. Also, hi, my name is Aimee and I'm 8 years old.
