# Zagreb, Day 17: Lost in a Mathematical Construct

Today, I got lost. Mind you, not in the city. Not in Zagreb. In Importanne Center, which is an underground mall in the city center. I have a natural affinity for getting lost in any sort of building that has negative floors. I would probably daftly lose myself in other mathematical constructs as well if they were provided to me, like maybe in a conic section or something? I don't know.

# Economics and Franchise and Competitive Business

Importanne Center is a strange mall. Arena Centar and Avenue Mall are great malls. Importanne Center has mostly very local businesses, mostly stores that (currently) sell prom dresses or very cheaply made clothing. It made me start to think about business here. I'm probably going to piss off Zagrebian people talking about this, but fuck it--it's my impression. I could go into this huge wash of jargon about America's mixed/market economy, capitalism, and Croatia's tertiary sector-driven economy... it all has a heavy influence on what I see, but I'm not going to talk about economics right now (maybe another time, because I do find it fascinating). Everyone knows that the United States has an exhaustive history of franchising. Take a successful business model... repeat it. Build loyalty with brand identity. Everyone knows that Americans have a love-hate relationship with franchise... we associate it with mediocrity and gentrification while simultaneously associating it with quality and predictability. We blame franchises for the failure of local business and startup business and "main street" in general. But look at any successful non-franchise business in the United States. It has a unique identity that it has established by the competitive threat produced by franchise. Occasionally, there's something like this where it's actually mediocre solely because it's clientele has been established as a group of "fuck the establishment, fuck the man!" types but generally speaking, if you know of an awesome local pizza place, it's awesome for a good reason--because the staff has incredible talent or because the ambience is amazing or because they have amazing deals. But what happens without franchise to set competitive standards? Everything starts to look the same. And that's how it all looks to me, an American. Two restaurants situated next to each other and I can't tell the difference... both have the same tired Jamnica and Karlovaƒçko banners slapped on the facade, the same ambience, and minimal signage directing your attention towards the establishment. You could have amazing food inside, but all I see is that you have beer and water based on the fact that you're advertising the two brands. So why do I want to go into "Caffe Bar 'Tony'"? What makes it any different from "Restoran 'Josip'" next door? Even the name is lazy. There's plenty of great places in Zagreb and I know it when I see it, but there's so much that could potentially be not mediocre out there that I will never see because it's drowned in a sheath of mediocrity. But yeah. I got lost in the mall. So try not to take my opinions too seriously, because, remember, I got lost in a mall. I walked by the same "Damaged Jeans" store 4 times in 10 minutes. There are half floors in Importanne Center. It goes down half a floor! What is that! Then, for no reason whatsoever, a spiral staircase. And weird sliding doors. And 'Izlaz' signs pointing to dead ends! Witchcraft, I say! So although nothing in this mall interested me (and it seemed overloaded with smokey cafes), it took me about 45 minutes to find my way out (the exit, ultimately seemed to be on the -1/2 floor... I don't know if I am imagining that). **Enough negative.**

# Sunshine

![untitled_by_fartprincess-d60whf9](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d60whf9.jpg) It was actually sunny out in Zagreb today. Like real sun. It was nice. I was able to wear a short-sleeved shirt and acquire Vitamin D3 and actually feel the sunlight hitting my skin, which is aching for color. There were a ton of people outside! I wanted to go check out Muzej Mimara but all the museums here are closed on Mondays. I did not know that. The old man at the desk was adorable, however. And sort of laughed in a bashful manner when he confirmed that it was open tomorrow and I said back, in Croatian: "Utorak! Devet do pet!" I'm trying to find any chance I can to speak the language. I was just wandering around aimlessly after realizing the museum was closed, hoping to find something cool and kill time before coming back to get some work done. I found a really cool park. It had statues but not of old historical figures or horses or whatever. No, it had statues of dismembered zombies and little girl butts. There were a lot of people in the park admiring baby girl ass: ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d60whv0](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d60whv0.jpg) **"Honey, I think we're like 3 days late memorializing Kurt Cobain's death."** ![brains_by_fartprincess-d60wi9i](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/brains_by_fartprincess-d60wi9i.jpg) Also I found someone's adorable dog waiting patiently outside of a market. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d60wij5](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d60wij5.jpg) The Cheshire cat goes corporate fat cat: ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d60wixi](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d60wixi.jpg) Here's a pretty dope joke I came up with today based on a store[?] I saw: ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d60x15h](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d60x15h.jpg) "Cuando en duda". That's as far as I got. "When in doubt..." 'cause, get it... the store is named "doubt" and you're in it and... fuck, why am I allowed to be alive. It's not even idiomatically correct because you'd actually say something like, "cuando tengas duda[s]"--so maybe this could be a fun pun about the store owner having duda. And again, I repeat, why am I allowed to be alive? 

# Croatians and Coffee Time

I hadn't written about this even though it was an observation I immediately made. It applies to other European countries too but it feels like so much more here in particular. Unlike American coffee houses where people often use them as de facto coworking spaces, hauling their laptops, headphones, and assorted other tech accessories with, coffee shops here are an entirely different thing. They are far more socially oriented. If you walk into a cafe, everyone is talking to someone. And they will stay there for hours. It's like Friends in the 90s--I imagine what US coffee shops were like before the Internet became revolutionary. This is one of the main plazas in the city center in the middle of the afternoon: ![plaza_by_fartprincess-d60wjex](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/plaza_by_fartprincess-d60wjex.jpg)
