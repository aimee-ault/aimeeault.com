# No-fucking-up-vember Week 1: Complete

I started a month of self-accountability this month called "[No-fucking-up-vember](/2014/10/31/no-fucking-up-vember/)". Today is the end of week 1. **Here are the highlights:**

  * Even though I only set out to do this for the sake of personal accountability and not getting gross diseases when I'm older... my clothes are fitting me better. It's not a _huge_ difference or anything, but I can just feel it.
  * As someone who loves to cook, I really am enjoying the aspect of working with base materials that I haven't used a lot, like nut-based ingredients. Coconut oil, almond flour, coconut milk... they seem to be staples. I enjoy finding new ways to cook vegetables I like as well, like sweet potato chips.
  * Gallon of water a day works. I don't really see it so much in my skin, but I didn't have a lot of skin imperfections to start. If anything, I guess my skin has a bit more glow to it now. It definitely shows in my hair though. It's regained a lot of flounce that seemed to have gone missing in the last year. As someone who has very, very thick wavy, curly hair, I'm seeing a lot less breakage too. Yay!
  * I generally wake up feeling very refreshed and not sleepy. Part of this may be the fact that I have almost eliminated caffeine from my diet. I drink a cup of cinnamon tea first thing in the morning, but that's it.
  * I have more time to do things that require hand-eye coordination now that I'm not drinking beer at all. Woo!
  * Doing pilates in conjunction with CrossFit has been wonderful. It helps me with core strength I definitely need for weightlifting. The increased flexibility is a nice perk, too.
  * Giving myself cheat meals, oddly, has made me less likely to cheat. I value them too much to waste them on things that are gross.
  * Cheat meals have been interesting. I appreciate the flavor _way_ more than I did when I ate these things regularly, but also my body has picked up a slightly better intuition as to what things are not nutritious. I also noticed I don't feel sodium bloat after eating these things now since they are rare (my first cheat meal was shrimp scampi and a piece of chocolate cake for dessert for anyone curious).
  * I often have tons of leftovers from things I make. This is great because after CrossFit, I want to do about... oh, 0 cooking and just want to funnel food into my mouth. Leftovers are a godsend for that.
  * I am far more selective about wine that I drink. Only the good stuff. No Whole Foods Malbecs for me, thanks.
  * I'm generally in a happier mood. Doing something good for myself feels good. It makes me feel somewhat more confident as well knowing I can succeed at a very difficult goal.
  * I'm not sure which aspect of it is providing this benefit (I suspect the vitamin D and omega 3 supplements) but I've had some rough rotator cuff pain for a long time and it's loosened up significantly in just a week. Basically, shoving foods with anti-inflammatory properties in your mouth makes your body feel pretty great on the whole.
**The lowlights:**

  * Have you drank a gallon of water a day? You will pee like 17 times a day. I also gained 8 pounds of water weight in a single day. On the flip side, by day 3, I had lost all 8 pounds along with 3 additional pounds, so... cool?
  * A couple of days I did not meet my water mark. I did drink anywhere from 10-14 glasses of water on those days though (this does not include any tea I drank).
  * Also, drinking that much water will make you want to barf no matter how much you space it out.
  * It took a couple of days for my body to get adjusted to the changes in my diet. I felt a tiny bit light-headed and weak, despite feeling perfectly sated. According to several websites of varying repute, this is because your body goes through a detox when you stop eating tons of sodium, sugar, and processed foods. I have no idea if this is true or not, but I know I felt shaky here and there... and then suddenly, by day 3, not at all and back to my regular--if not more energetic--self. It was kind of like having caffeine withdrawal, if I had to compare it to something.
  * Paleo cooking is time-consuming! On my first night, my boyfriend was over and helped me make dinner. It felt like we were cooking for 2 hours. It was probably just an hour, but just imagine spending 3 hours of your day cooking. I think as I get more used to being in the habit of cooking, I'll get faster about it.
  * Some vegetables I'm already sick of. I like zucchini, but I've seen recipes where it is used as bread and I don't really enjoy find the texture of a big long slice of it to be very palatable.
  * I still am struggling to get 8-9 hours of sleep. Before this experiment, I was averaging 6-7.5. I'd say at the moment, I've increased that number to 7.5-8.25, depending on the night.  I'm a light sleeper and my bedroom is directly above a busy street so I'm not really surprised by any of this.
  * I've had a runny nose for the past few days. I like to think this is actually like my body resisting a cold it would have normally picked up. My immune system was pretty crappy. That's another thing I'm hoping will get better with these changes.
Here's what it all looks like: ![SAMSUNG CSC](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/SAM_3309-1024x682.jpg) ![SAMSUNG CSC](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/SAM_3308-1024x682.jpg) This is one of my favorite recipes I picked up. It's granola. You put some cashews, almonds, and unsweetened coconut flakes in a food processor, then coat that mixture in coconut oil, vanilla extract, and a tiny smidge of ginger honey and bake it for 18 minutes at 300 degrees. Then lightly sprinkle sea salt on it after it's done (I added some dried cranberries to mine too). It made my kitchen smell like vanilla too, which was rad, and tastes better than any granola I've ever bought in stores. ![SAMSUNG CSC](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/SAM_3315-1024x682.jpg)   If any of these things look appetizing, the recipes for them [can be acquired on Paleogrubs.com](http://paleogrubs.com/paleo-diet-meal-plan) **This is my pantry.

## Comments

**[Woody](#115 "2014-11-07 17:44:53"):** Word, yo. Gwen and I started going gluten free about two months ago - her more strictly than me, I was making exceptions for beer - and after about two weeks, I could feel the gluten immediately when I ingested it. In mid-October, I heard about paleo and was immediately interested. It seems to me that many of the benefits paleo offers actually come from eliminating gluten: increased energy, weight loss, and better concentration all happened to me after a month of no gluten. Since I eliminated beer and grain alcohols, sleep cycles have improved too. I'm not quite ready to jump fully into paleo, primarily because I'm a sucker for rice, corn chips, and cheese, but have definitely started shifting my cooking in that direction and it feels damn good. And I'm concerned that eliminating grain and dairy will force a much higher level of meat consumption, which is something I try not to rely on, because factory meat is so awful and free range meat so hard to find (not to mention expensive). Fish and seafood has its own share of issues, eg. relying on tuna is not environmentally sustainable. None of the paleo research I've done adequately addresses these issues, in my opinion.

**[aimee](#116 "2014-11-08 19:58:28"):** Yeah, finding environmentally sustainable meat has been a big thing on my mind in all of this. I've been trying to find local butchers who can tell me where exactly everything is from (not to mention probably vastly cheaper too), but so many recipes use salmon which I know is nearly impossible to find not farmed. Finding free range chicken hasn't been too bad but it's meant a lot of looking up the farms to make sure their definition of "free range" is in line with what I think it should mean. Trying to supplement more egg for protein and beefing up on the healthy fat foods like avocado instead. It's been okay.

**[Woody](#117 "2014-11-08 20:06:29"):** > many recipes use salmon which I know is nearly impossible to find not farmed

In many ways, farmed salmon is more sustainable than wild caught. (This is also particularly true for shrimp.) The problem is finding reliably good sources of farmed seafood, because many places produce complete junk, using dirty tanks, subpar food, etc. EcoFish has a number of responsibly sourced products, including a really excellent farmed shrimp that I buy almost exclusively.

**[Woody](#118 "2014-11-08 20:17:02"):** Another good source of farmed fish is [Verlasso](http://www.verlasso.com/). That said, I do agree that you simply cannot beat the high omega and low fat content of wild caught salmon.

**[David](#119 "2014-11-10 03:33:21"):** For beef, there's buying a percentage of a cow direct from a farm. I've done this, but the disadvantage is that even a quarter cow (which is what I wound up with) is a _huge_ amount of meat, and the farm will want to sell the output of a whole cow at once for obvious reasons, so you'd probably need to find friends who want to go in on it with you. The per-pound price is very reasonable (~$3/lb, so about cheap-ground-beef prices) but it includes bones. It's a big up-front cost, and basically demands that you obtain a chest freezer to store the meat for the many months it will take you to consume it all.

**[aimee](#120 "2014-11-10 21:07:10"):** Haha, I can't imagine myself taking part in that. Given my propensity to jump ship and leave places for weeks or months at a time, I'm going to guess a lot of that meat would go to waste. Good to know in the future though.

**[David](#121 "2014-11-10 21:10:56"):** You could be very popular with your friends when you vanish! Give them all reliably-sourced steaks to remember you by. :D

**[aimee](#122 "2014-11-10 21:32:06"):** True, but you can always get omega 3 from chia seeds as well, which can be grown in your own garden :)
