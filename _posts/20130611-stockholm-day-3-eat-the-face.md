# Stockholm, Day 3: Eat the Face!

Yesterday, I got a "fan letter." I've received a lot of letters, notes, and e-mails from people since I started this trip, completely unexpectedly and each time I do it rocks me a bit, but this one was touching because they told me that my writing had inspired them to get out of the country and travel finally. If I've helped one person see that they can do that, I'm happy. Hearing that made my day, my week even.  ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d68majh](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d68majh.jpg) A few days ago, a stranger sent me a link to a song called "I Like Giants," which was an absolutely adorable song but I started to listen to other songs by the same artist and found one with these lyrics and I really identified with it: "I'm trying to be brave because when I'm brave, other people feel brave." I've tried really hard while traveling to marginalize some of my weaker moments because I feel like they aren't entertaining, yet sometimes these are the most sincere parts of me. As a woman, I am always feeling this compulsion to prove to the world that I'm strong. I try to be a warrior or a viking, ignoring the fact that some of the strongest people in the world are the ones who are humble and can admit to their weaknesses, if only to overcome them and show the world that they are conquerers. Last week, one of my coworkers jokingly posted on Twitter an edited version of Masslow's Hierarchy of Needs with an extra bottom tier labeled "Internet," saying that this was "Aimee's Hierarchy of Needs." Shortly after that, another coworker commented on it, also jokingly saying that really, the graph of my need doesn't even need a "safety and security" tier. It was a joke, but there is something to that that I should point out. **Being nomadic and especially being ascetic changes where you derive safety and security.** For most pople, safety and security comes from others, from a place, from money, from belongings. A nomad and an ascetic will learn, with time and much discipline, that safety and security comes from within yourself. It comes from the knowledge that you are making contributions to the world and that you know how to manage yourself to achieve both physical and emotional homeostasis with any environment you are thrown into. This can be a brutally difficult thing to achieve. It means letting go of the things that have always annoyed you. Letting go of your fears. And accepting that the journey and adventure to getting anything you want in life starts from inside you. I know this much. Anyway, enough with all this gab. 

# Food

Last night I went to La Neta. It's a popular restaurant and I liked it because you have to speak Spanish there. I got tacos al pastor. A surprising number of Swedes speak Spanish. I don't know why, so I can only hope it's because Sweden is full of language-loving nerds. When I listen in on other people's conversations, I notice nearly half the conversations I hear are in English, despite all parties being Swedish. At La Neta, a lot of people were speaking in Spanish and a few in French and Catalan (I find it difficult to tell the two apart sometimes... I had a Catalan speaker get pissed at me on Twitter not long ago for even insinuating that the two have similarities). ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d68ma96](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d68ma96.jpg) La Neta was authentically good, which is hard to come by in Europe (if anyone read my two different taco experiences in Croatia). My picture, however, makes it look like a pile of dog food slopped on a large disc-shaped bandage, I think. A lot of European places get avocado but they import it from Thailand... the avocados usually come to these countries underripe and more chunky than smoothy and creamy. It's kind of unfortunate, really because avocado can really shape the flavor and texture of a dish significantly. When I was in Serbia, I bought an avocado that was underripe, placed it in a paper bag and then watched it go bad a day later before it had managed to ripen. Go figure. Speaking of tropical fruit, people sell bananas on the street here a lot. I haven't figured this out. They can even sort of be aggressive about it, approaching you with a single banana, thrusting it in your face, "You want this?" I laugh and shake my head no, and there is now a thorny chasm of rejection settled between us in which the man is still gripping a banana so tightly in his fist that I am picturing how far I think it might rocket upwards if the fruit were to project out of its peel. But instead, he opens it himself and begins to eat it, giving a furtive gander of "Well, you missed your chance at this miraculous yellow fruit that you can't get anywhere else in the world." And I step away. 

# Skansen and Djurgården

Today I went to Skansen. It's on an island called Djurgården, which is part of the Stockholm archipelago. This is probably the most popular island in the archipelago because it is not just home to Skansen but also a theme park named Gröna Lund and a few museums. Skansen, which I keep typing as Skanksen is hard to explain. If I were to say it's an "open air museum," I think that would conjure the wrong image. Same goes for "park," or "zoo." Honestly, it reminded me somewhat of those colonial or civil war recreation sites in America, except more pacifistic. It was very nature-y. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d68mafh](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d68mafh.jpg) This is probably the most retarded thing I have ever written, but one of the things I like about traveling is that I get to see where artistic inspiration was drawn for some of the scenes, settings, and levels in video games I have played. Titan Quest was a great example of that for both Athens and Rome. I honestly think that Silverpine Forest from World of Warcraft was modeled after Skansen. I also get the same vibe for the Lumberyard map in Team Fortress 2, not a map I have played often because when I do get the chance to play, I usually stick to Dustbowl or another control point map. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d68mahx](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d68mahx.jpg) There were women in the bakehouse who made bread and let you eat it. I asked one of them what their favorite thing about working in the bakehouse was. She looked out the window thoughtfully and replied back, "talking about bread." I chortled but she was very serious about it! She loved bread! And the bread was very good. They had a wood-burning stove there and you could watch them rolling it out with the flour. There were also a lot of knitting ladies.
