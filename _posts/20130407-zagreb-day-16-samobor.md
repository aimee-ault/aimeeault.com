# Zagreb, Day 16: Samobor

Yesterday, the U.S. embassy in Zagreb issued a warning to U.S. citizens staying here to avoid the city center on Sunday due to some xenophobic war veterans who would be protesting the introduction of Cyrillic script and Serbian language into local schools. I'm like a kid though. You tell me not to do something, I'm going to do it just to be rebellious.  But I didn't because I ended up going with a couple of friends to the neighboring town of Samobor today, which translates to "only pine" but it also translates to "only boron" which makes the nerd in me happier (even though I was told that it wasn't boron, like the element). The green flag is the flag of Samobor and the red, white, and blue flag is the Croatian flag. My hoodie is doing some weird unnatural tenting effect that makes me look like I'm like 4 months pregnant or something. Before I came to Croatia, I tried to get AT&T to unlock my iPhone 5 so I could use a local SIM card. Despite the fact that I have been with AT&T for 6 years now, they refused without giving me any specific reason. Not wanting to repeat my somewhat costly adventures from last summer, I bought the smallest international data plan available for my phone. I thought doing this would be to my detriment, that it would rob me of adventure, but I almost never use it to consult maps, just for iMessage, e-mail, and proving people wrong in debates :P But Luka loaned me an old, old iPhone the other day which has a SIM card in it. So this is me time traveling to 2009: ![oldiphone_by_fartprincess-d60s74u](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/oldiphone_by_fartprincess-d60s74u.jpg) I'm only bringing this up to comment that Croatian keyboard layouts don't have QWERTY. They have QWERTZ. Which makes sense, of course, given that there is no Y in the Croatian alphabet, but the letters are transposed on the keyboard, so it is still there, just where Z would be. I'll also point out that if you have an American iCloud/iTunes account, you won't be allowed to access the European app store... it'll force you to browse the American one. Not that I know the difference, but now I am left wondering For breakfast today, I had strudla višnja. I saw a local commenting somewhere (in Croatian, probably not realizing I could understand what they were saying) making fun of me for trying things without knowing what they were. I don't really mind though--I keep doing it. Doing this, I learned that višnja is cherry. Not my favorite of the fruits, but eh. Sometimes I wish I could blog smells because sometimes the smell of meat in a store here is the best thing ever. I have started to notice that all old women here look the same to me. They all wear like, neon pink lipstick and have enormous glasses. They look like the old woman from that Aphex Twin "Come to Daddy" video from the 90s. Anyway. The ride to Samobor was fun. It partially reminded me of rural France. It partially reminded me of rural North Carolina. The buildings along the way were extremely rustic. I don't even like the word "rustic," it's on par with describing food as "artisan," but "dilapidated" sounds too harsh. And if I said "quaint," I'd probably need a small hand gun to shoot myself with. What I do know is that the countryside is the countryside. It doesn't vary much from country to country. The houses are usually old. The land is plotted similarly. The rusty hoe sits by the tired, sleeping dog. The picture below, most people will think, "that looks like like any sleepy mountain town!" And it does. ![samborhills_by_fartprincess-d60saqn](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/samborhills_by_fartprincess-d60saqn.jpg) From far off, this probably looks like a pleasant little Bob Ross painting. But up close, in the valley, it's different. ![samoborhouses_by_fartprincess-d60sb36](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/samoborhouses_by_fartprincess-d60sb36.jpg) I know there are people in the US who would kill for that sort of exposed brickwork facade on their home, but I'm sure they all only want it in a faux-chic Pier 1 sense. As the old saying goes: "Home is where the brick pile is." ![brickpile_by_fartprincess-d60sbvl](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/brickpile_by_fartprincess-d60sbvl.jpg) Anyway, getting out and walking into Samobor, one of the very first things I noticed was that up on the mountain there was an enormous ruins of an old castle. I immediately concluded that it must be explored. It was a bit up a fairly steep mountain. I'd rate the hiking up to the ruins as medium-level hiking. Once up there, there were these windows that remained. I wanted my picture in the window. This required a little bit of rock-climbing on my part. I was impressed that ultimately I was able to get up without any assistance. ![castle_by_fartprincess-d60sd3x](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/castle_by_fartprincess-d60sd3x.jpg) Awesome ruins, not-so-awesome "pregnancy" hoodie. Once we were done with the ruins, there was even more up the mountain. At this point the hiking went from moderate to extremely strenuous, extremely steep, and somewhat dangerous. As in, you had to grasp at ground roots to get foothold and sort of scale the path like a spider. It was fun! I love hiking. It's one of my favorite things. I especially like when I get a giant burst of energy and just start darting up the mountain, refusing to look back. When my friends were sort of stopping, I saw a gigantic lookout tower at the top, and yelled back, "THERE'S A FUCKING LOOKOUT TOWER. COME ON." This marks the second time in one month that I have pushed a group of guys to trek up a mountain in the pursuit of something amazing and ultimately "worth it." Scaling a mountain excites me because it is a physical manifestation of a challenge to be conquered. And I will never stop running and jumping and yelling, "THIS IS AWESOME." The top was pretty incredible. ![lookouttower_by_fartprincess-d60secb](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/lookouttower_by_fartprincess-d60secb.jpg) The ruins I visited: ![ruins_by_fartprincess-d60seyl](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/ruins_by_fartprincess-d60seyl.jpg) ![viewfromtower_by_fartprincess-d60semf](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/viewfromtower_by_fartprincess-d60semf.jpg) Ironically, there was a road that ran by the lookout tower, making the whole hike seem pointless. But you know, as a famous poet once said, I think it was like Jay-Z or something, "I took the road less traveled" and supposedly that made all the difference.
