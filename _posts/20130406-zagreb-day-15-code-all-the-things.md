# Zagreb, Day 15: Code All The Things

For a brief moment, I was worried I'd have nothing to write today. And I kind of don't, not too much about Zagreb itself anyway, namely because I was consumed with programming. Today was a cruel test of sleep schedule failure. In Europe, my bedtime is anywhere from 3:30AM to 4:30AM. But a couple of days ago, Luka asked me if I wanted to go with him to Zagreb's monthly PHP User Group meeting, which was at 9AM this morning. Given that I have been waking up anywhere from 11AM to 1PM, this was not very easy, I swear. _"There's an 8 in the morning now?"_

# Development and Frameworks

The PHP User Group topic was the Yii framework. I'm going to very upfrontly state, knowing that there is a very real possibility that my fellow developer friends may read this, that I find PHP MVC frameworks to be a colossal waste of [my] time. CakePHP, Kohana, Code Igniter, Zend... I hate them all--they're all terrible. In the off chance that anyone _is_ reading this, don't even message me about it or comment on it... just silently accept it. Write it off that I'm an idiot, I don't care. This is where I'll also get it off my chest that as time goes on, I am liking OOP less and less too. Yeah it's great that frameworks have authentication systems and a few other things already written that save you time, but fuck, they waste so much more time beyond that. But I wasn't going to pass up the opportunity to go check out what the local developer scene was like. It was a day-long thing and all in Croatian. I questioned what it must be like to be multi-lingual from a young age and be a developer and wondered if it ever caught people offguard when naming variables ("Did I name it 'iterator' or 'iterador'?") I've always, wrongly, assumed that developers stick to English naming conventions when doing development. 

# Geolocation and American Sign Language Tools

I decided to take advantage of the time and got to work on something I've wanted to work on for a while but have been too busy to, an abbreviated online ASL dictionary. All of the ones I have found online are awful. Even the one that I actually respect, curated by Dr. Bill Vicars, is lacking in many ways. I initially started to build it as a way of studying ASL diagrams from Gallaudet University on my phone while I travel, but beyond that, I had an even cooler idea. Because ASL varies so much from region to region, I thought it would be cool if I allowed people to submit videos of themselves signing words and geolocating them so that not only can you can see what a sign looks like from region to region but you can also read any etymological notes submitted or hints, mnemonics, or tips with each sign. I had built the dictionary itself but not the prototype for the geolocatable part, so I actually built that today! Unlike things I've built before that I dropped, I feel strongly passionate about this because I know that it is useful and will benefit many people, whether they're learning sign language, are language lovers, or are linguists studying the roots for anthropologic/sociologic reasons. I also enjoyed it because it gave me a chance to study ASL for the first time in a little while :) Anyway, enough about that. 

# Pizza

I feel like I've been holding something back from people who have never left the US. Prepare to have your mind blown. People outside of the US eat pizza with a knife and fork. I'm totally serious. By now, it's old hat to me and whenever I see it, I just think, "Welp, that guy just cut an 8" pizza up into 47 different pieces like he's going to feed it to a toddler except I know he's not, he's just being totally classy." Whereas I actually do eat like a toddler and would probably benefit from it the most. And yet I do a fantastic job of representing America while abroad. Today I learned that in Croatia people sometimes put ketchup and/or mayonaise on their pizza. Not that anyone did that in the group today. But Luka claims ketchup on pizza really is a thing and that he has done it before. He seemed repulsed when I mentioned mayonaise, but there it was on the menu. Also easy to miss on the menu was kukuruz (corn) and ajvar (chutney). I feel like if I laughed at these in front of someone from here, they'd probably look at me incredulously like, "Why is that funny? It's normal." ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d60nu9f](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d60nu9f.jpg) One thing that is funny to me in Croatia is getting the English menu. Really, dining at all with a Croatian speaker because no matter if you get the English menu or the people you are with do the talking for you, you look and feel like a child. It would be more endearing to me if my menu came with a pack of crayons and a maze on it or something. People think I am crazy for it, but I usually do better picking randomly off the Croatian menu or enjoy the challenge of making sense of it. As much as I make fun of ketchup on pizza, you better believe I'd try it. Honestly, I think anyone could very easily troll me with food if they wanted to. Just tell me this is a local culinary delight, a platter of weevils baked in Siracha, and I'd probably buy it. But you know what? At least I'm going to die knowing that I did a _lot_ of stuff in my life. Like eating pelican gizzard stew. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d60nu96](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d60nu96.jpg) The funny thing to me about Croatia is that, of all the things I have put in Luka's fridge while here, they are all retardedly healthy things. For example, right now, I have a tin of sardines, some milk, some kiwi and pineapple, and a box of bean sprouts. In America, people sometimes keep junk food in their cupboard for when they're feeling lazy. For me, it's healthy food, for when I'm just too worn out on the continual CELEBRATION OF THE WORLD'S BEST MEAT. Today I had an unusual interaction with a woman. Knowing I was not from the area, she tried her best to speak English with me. At one point, she couldn't think of the word she wanted in English and then apologized to me. All I could do was laugh and smile and say, "Hey there now, you shouldn't be the one apologizing. You're bending over backwards to communicate with me when I'm a guest in your country. It's admirable and polite that you care." Also apparently, I can't do anything tomorrow because, you know, [I'll have a bad time](http://zagreb.usembassy.gov/service/messages/rally.html) if I do according to the U.S. embassy (apparently some xenophobic group of war veterans is looking for skulls to crush). I'm smart and I know nothing will happen to me. But I find it funny after having called my mom for the first time in a long time and telling her that I am totally safe here as an American and that no one wants to kill me.
