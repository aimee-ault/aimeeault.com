# Zagreb, Day 19: Super-Hero Mode

I almost didn't write today. It would have been easy for me not to, not because I didn't do anything, but because I was really lost in my thoughts. A few days ago, I gave a big list of advice to people who want to travel. If you follow my advice and travel in the same fashion that I do, your life will change. I won't say whether that will be for the better or worse, because that's ultimately up to you, but it will change you--it has to. That's how life works. You go places and those places make an impact on you and you become redefined by your experiences. If you are even slightly human, you will re-evaluate who you are based on those experiences and you will grow.  Sometimes, as you are living it, you will have mild identity crises. I don't necessarily mean that negatively (though it could be, it just hasn't been for me). You just sort of look at yourself and think, "Who the fuck am I?!" For me, this has been purely positive, but sometimes I don't know how to handle the information--it hits so rapidly. Throwing yourself into adventure, whatever it is, headfirst, will do that to you. This is why people get addicted to skydiving (which purely is throwing yourself headfirst into adventure ;)), they become adrenaline junkies. I think traveling is the same way. Lost in my thoughts today, the significance of my adventures hit me. You are a D&D character. You have an alignment. You have qualities. Characteristics. Your adventures do not change that alignment. They skill up your character--they make the qualities that make you you more potent. Every day, you should be fighting and questing to be a hero. You have to know what your weapons are though. And that's been something I only recently understood, when it was pointed out to me. I have always, for my entire life, had my shield up, never my weapon out. How can you fight when you're just blocking all the time? I wasn't being a hero. I was just letting the world fight for me. So I've started fighting the battles. And it feels good. Real good. 

# Meat

Yesterday, Tatjana made meat that I got to try. Having lived in the US forever and most of my meat-related experiences being processed, extremely high in sodium and preservatives and whatever else, this was really, really good, full of flavor. Full of pepper. Spicey. Good. You can't beat that meat :D She was also really nice and gave me a Kinder Surprise egg. It had a race car inside! It kind of made my day. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d6148pu](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d6148pu.jpg) So, thanks Tatjana :) 

# Babby's First Street Art

Last night, I contributed a little bit to the street art scene in Zagreb. If anyone is outraged, let me reassure you that I didn't defile any old, gorgeous building. It was a very mundane subterranean tunnel. I added what I would consider to be the most, from anecdotal evidence, utilitarian street art possible. I won't spoil what it was (I'm still working on it), but it's a very popular piece of graffiti in Austin that people seem to love. So I figure people here will enjoy it too, or my creative interpretation of it at least. If you are in Zagreb, you can check it out for yourself; it's in the tunnel closest to Avenue Mall from the west. It should be obvious what it is because it's relatively large and it's in English and it's very polite. I also added something smaller nearby but I don't consider that street art :) ![peoplewillforget_by_fartprincess-d614amz](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/peoplewillforget_by_fartprincess-d614amz.jpg)

# Ethnography

I went to the ethnography museum. I don't ordinarily go to museums so much, but Zagreb has a lot of museums. Like that seems to be a large part of what downtown is! When I went in, I was confused because it was full of an entire class of school kids. I was mostly curious to see how Croatia was going to present its own anthropological roots. It was a very narrowly focused museum. The first floor was an exhibit on toys, which dated back to maybe late 19th century? Nothing really seemed out of line with what I'd imagine toys in 19th century America to look like. Wooden horses. Awkward dolls with yarn for hair. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d614bsv](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d614bsv.jpg) ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d614bsk](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d614bsk.jpg) I thought it was interesting that English children's books have been popular in Croatia for at least several decades. It's not exactly a recent phenomenon. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d614cdq](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d614cdq.jpg) If you go into Algoritam or Profil here now, the English section for children's books is indubitably larger than the Croatian selection. The games had some kind of racist Sambo thing going on: ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d614cmn](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d614cmn.jpg) I thought this was cool. I would have loved to play with this when I was a kid. I'd even love it now. ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d614cub](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d614cub.jpg) The second floor and part of the first floor were focused on clothing. Nothing too shocking here either. Surprise, women of the Adriatic Region of Croatia wore coarse hemp shirts because they were poor. The only thing that surprised me was that the museum guide claimed that some regions had oriental influence in "costume" attire. Which is strange for a country that is so absorbed in and shaped on the culture of surrounding countries. In case you suspected that maybe the women in 18th century rural and coastal Croatia were walking around in wool g-strings and pasties, I can assure you they weren't: ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d614bs7](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d614bs7.jpg) **Bummer.** I have to admit that that line-up intrigues me, though, especially the second chick with her odd fur trapper's hat, brocade jacket, and tri-color full-length skirt. Peasantry, my ass. And of course, the flying nun over on the right. This was probably the most bizarre thing I took away from my trip: ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d614cy1](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d614cy1.jpg)
