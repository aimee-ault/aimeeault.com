# Belgrade, Day 18: Fish Boner

Today I was supposed to meet a couple of friends and some friends of friends at Topćiderska Reka. I didn't make it there because instead I ended up at a hospital. Not as a patient, mind you, just as a lost and confused denizen of Klinicki Centar Srbije, this giant medical park in the southwest part of the city (we ended up catching lunch later, so I'm not the worst friend in the world, but I'm still sad I didn't make it down there). I was really, really shocked by what I saw in the medical park though.  By now, the culture shock of smoking has passed me. I get it, America is one of the few countries that is truly cracking down on smoking. I've gone to a few night clubs and bars in Zagreb and Belgrade and been exposed to the viscous haze of cigarette smoke from every other patron in the place. However, it was really alarming when I got to the medical park and found everyone there was walking around with a cigarette in their hand. In a place that is supposed to be healthy. It felt more concentrated than if I had been walking in the city center. I couldn't seem to escape it. Even the hospital personnel, in their white scrubs, were sucking down the nicotine. The park also had these smaller old houses that looked like they were specialists, along with a few apothecaries. There was a lot of construction going on with dirt and dust blowing up in the air. A lot of people sat out baking in the sun. It just didn't seem like a very healthy place and yet I couldn't find my way out of the maze-like roads. Until I eventually did. For lunch I brought with me some of this tulumba I got yesterday: ![4532fbb8bc9711e2bb0922000a1fbf4a_7_by_fartprincess-d65clgy](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/4532fbb8bc9711e2bb0922000a1fbf4a_7_by_fartprincess-d65clgy.jpg) It's a Turkish dessert (I feel like every dessert or pastry that is popular here is actually from either Turkey or Bosnia). It's a fried dough that is dipped in a very thick syrup. The syrup is comparable to maple syrup. I don't really care for it that much. It just feels too sweet and too thick. I like baklava but baklava has a texture that works with its syrup. This just feels too sponge-like and like it is thoroughly absorbing the syrup. But it's still good, just not something I'd want to eat a lot. After that, I was walking through Karađorđev. I love that OSX will give you the option to use all the other letters of the Serbo-Croatian alphabet by default but not with that particular letter, đ. Go fuck yourself, Apple. I sat down for a minute and a little boy ran up to me and started begging me for money, holding his hand out. I thought that was kind of sad. I've read about people making their kids beg, but it was the first time I had seen it. And the kid is too young to really know what they're doing or that it's socially unacceptable. I don't think we really have these types of beggars in the US. Most in the US have a story and are very obtrusive and aggressive in nature. Even the more passive ones try to make a scene by having a sign that tells their story ("Out of work, could use whatever you have"), sometimes even taking a stab at humor ("Don't want money, just beer") to tug at your heartstrings. Here, you will often see these people just sitting on the street with their hand permanently placed out to collect money. It is in some way effective for them. I think it's the presence of a hand instead of a jar or a hat. Something about extending your hand makes you seem vulnerable. This woman had an infant: ![untitled_by_fartprincess-d65chkm](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/untitled_by_fartprincess-d65chkm.jpg) I feel like I don't know enough to make judgments. There's a deep history here that makes these people so disconnected and it is, well, fascinating to me. I don't think they're bad people. But I don't know anything beyond that. ![2013_05_15_13_21_23_2_by_fartprincess-d65cj7n](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/2013_05_15_13_21_23_2_by_fartprincess-d65cj7n.jpg) Of all the things I see on buildings and stuff, "volim te" tops them all. Of all the emotions that brings people to deface property, love sings loudest and proudest. ![2013_05_15_13_24_11_1_by_fartprincess-d65civh](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/2013_05_15_13_24_11_1_by_fartprincess-d65civh.jpg) This is the Cathedral of St. Sava. Again, not religious, don't care about this kind of stuff, but it was huge. Everyone walking out, turns back to the inside and does the sign of the cross. I decided to cross into it. I surprisingly did not become immediately enveloped in flames. The inside was bizarre though. It wasn't a typical church, but this big cavernous room with precariously scattered portraits of religious icons on easels. One woman was crying as she stood by one. There were candles lit. A man approached me and started waving his fingers at me. I wasn't allowed to wear my earbuds inside. All these different cathedrals have all these different rules. What type of clothes you can wear. No photography. No talking. No taking your penis out and waving it in people's faces. ![2013_05_15_13_29_25_2_by_fartprincess-d65cin0](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/2013_05_15_13_29_25_2_by_fartprincess-d65cin0.jpg) That is some pretty intense architecture and epic lighting all the same. All the buildings here look amazing. ![2013_05_15_13_38_32_2_by_fartprincess-d65ciio](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/2013_05_15_13_38_32_2_by_fartprincess-d65ciio.jpg) A lot of people here sell shoelaces. That's a big thing on the streets. I don't know why. Maybe I just notice it because it's so vibrant. ![2013_05_15_12_08_05_by_fartprincess-d65ce9f](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/2013_05_15_12_08_05_by_fartprincess-d65ce9f.jpg) I stopped into the farmers' market to get ingredients to make moussaka. The market here, just as it is in Zagreb, is bustling. ![2013_05_15_12_22_36_by_fartprincess-d65ceiy](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aimeeault.com/2013_05_15_12_22_36_by_fartprincess-d65ceiy.jpg) Another building that was bombed in the war but left to stand as an icon. I also like just listening to people greet their friends from across the street. Loudly.

I also like watching people experiment with language in street art, especially English. These are people after my own heart, forming combinations of words that are nonsensical but hilarious. "Excuse me, but where is Sugar???" and "fish boner" are my favorites so far.
